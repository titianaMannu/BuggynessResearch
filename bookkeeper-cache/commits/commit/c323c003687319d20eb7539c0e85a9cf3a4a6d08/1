Design\n \n In Hedwig, clients publish messages associated with a topic, and they subscribe to a topic to receive all messages published with that topic. Clients are associated with (publish to and subscribe from) a Hedwig _instance_ (also referred to as a _region_), which consists of a number of servers called _hubs_. The hubs partition up topic ownership among themselves, and all publishes and subscribes to a topic must be done to its owning hub.
