If the client is still active, it should detect the bookie failure, and start writing to a new ledger segment, and a new ensemble, which doesn't include the failed bookie. Creating new ledger segment will define the end of the previous segment. If, after the grace period, the ledger segment's end has not been defined, we assume the writing client has crashed.
