Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n+\n+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n+\n+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n+      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n+\n+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n+\n+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n+      replaced with your own identifying information.
