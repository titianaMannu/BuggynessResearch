check for running without journal (#2936)\n\n* Data integrity check\r\n\r\nThe integrity check is comprised two parts: a preboot check that\r\nis triggered by either an unclean shutdown or an invalid cookie.\r\nThe preboot check marks any open ledgers as both fenced and in\r\nlimbo to prevent ledgers affected by potential data loss from\r\nbeing written to. The limbo status prevents NoSuchEntry and\r\nNoSuchLedger responses from being sent which avoid ledger\r\ntruncation from any ledger recovery operations. Finally it sets\r\na storage flag that a full check is required.\r\n\r\nA new data integrity check service has been to run the full\r\nintegrity check once the bookie is running. If the service\r\nsees that the full check storage flag is set then it runs\r\na full check. This involves scanning the index and comparing\r\nit against metadata to discover missing entries. Any\r\nmissing entries are sourced from peer bookies by the\r\nEntryCopier and written to ledger storage.\r\n\r\nThe data integrity check also has a different cookie validation\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\nThe following configurations have been added to the conf\r\nfile:\r\n- dataIntegrityCheckingEnabled=true/false. False by default.\r\n  This config enables or disables data integrity checking.\r\n  When set to false the legacy cookie validation is used.\r\n- dataIntegrityStampMissingCookies=true/false. False by\r\n  default. This config allows the data integrity process\r\n  to stamp new cookies if a cookie is missing from a\r\n  directory. The full check will repair any lost data if\r\n  the directory data was lost.\r\n\r\n* Cookie verification for data integrity checking\r\n\r\nThe algorithm differs from that of LegacyCookieValidation in the\r\nfollowing ways:\r\n\r\n- A empty directory isn't considered a fatal condition.

We cannot response with a\r\nNoSuchEntryException or NoSuchLedgerException as this tell the client\r\nthat we never had the requested entry, which may or may not be true,\r\nbut if we tell it to the client, the client will act like it's true\r\nand possible mark the end of the ledger at an incorrect point.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds locking to LedgerMetadataIndex. Previously it\r\nrelied on the good graces to the calling code to avoid modifying the\r\nsame ledger concurrently. Now that we are also using the index to\r\nstore limbo state, we can't be so blasé.\r\n\r\n* Add entryExists call to ledgerStorage\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to check if an entry exists in the storage is\r\nto try to read the entry. However, this means pulling data out of the\r\nentrylog, which it should be sufficient to check that the entry exists\r\nin the index.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the entryExists call to ledgerStorage. This has only\r\nbeen implemented for DbLedgerStorage. The implementation for the\r\nothers should be trivial, but it needs to be tested.\r\n\r\n* Pregenerate the writeset from ledger metadata\r\n\r\nThe bookkeeper client uses DistributionSchedule (of which\r\nRoundRobinDistributionSchedule is the only impl) to decide which\r\nmembers of the ensemble it writes an entry to. This writeset is\r\ngenerated for each entry. However, there is only |ensemble| possible\r\nwritesets, so we should pregenerate them for the ledger and stop\r\ntrashing memory.\r\n\r\nWriteSets represent a set of pregenerated writesets as would be\r\notherwise generated from the distribution schedule. The constructor\r\ntakes a list of indices (which should be generated based on the list\r\nof bookies in the ensemble), which specifies the preferred order that\r\nbookies should be tried for reads.\r\n\r\n* Storage state flags for LedgerStorage\r\n\r\nIf a bookie crashes in the middle of a full integrity check, it needs\r\nto know to start it again when it reboots.

The limbo status prevents NoSuchEntry and\r\nNoSuchLedger responses from being sent which avoid ledger\r\ntruncation from any ledger recovery operations. Finally it sets\r\na storage flag that a full check is required.\r\n\r\nA new data integrity check service has been to run the full\r\nintegrity check once the bookie is running. If the service\r\nsees that the full check storage flag is set then it runs\r\na full check. This involves scanning the index and comparing\r\nit against metadata to discover missing entries. Any\r\nmissing entries are sourced from peer bookies by the\r\nEntryCopier and written to ledger storage.\r\n\r\nThe data integrity check also has a different cookie validation\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\nThe following configurations have been added to the conf\r\nfile:\r\n- dataIntegrityCheckingEnabled=true/false. False by default.\r\n  This config enables or disables data integrity checking.\r\n  When set to false the legacy cookie validation is used.\r\n- dataIntegrityStampMissingCookies=true/false. False by\r\n  default. This config allows the data integrity process\r\n  to stamp new cookies if a cookie is missing from a\r\n  directory. The full check will repair any lost data if\r\n  the directory data was lost.\r\n\r\n* Cookie verification for data integrity checking\r\n\r\nThe algorithm differs from that of LegacyCookieValidation in the\r\nfollowing ways:\r\n\r\n- A empty directory isn't considered a fatal condition. It just means\r\n  that the preboot phase of the data integrity checker must run. Once\r\n  the preboot phase runs, it should be safe to stamp the cookies\r\n  again.\r\n- Bookies are not allowed to change their identity. If they do, manual\r\n  operator intervention is required (which is ok as it is expected\r\n  that an operator would have to intervene to change the identity in\r\n  the first place).\r\n- A missing cookie in zookeeper is only valid, if there are no cookies\r\n  in any of the directories, as this is considered a new\r\n  boot. Otherwise, manual operator intervention is required.\r\n\r\n* Async iterator for ledger metadata\r\n\r\nCommon code for iterating over ledger metadata.

Also extract the cookie validation into a separate\r\ninjectable interface.\r\n\r\nThe metadata driver is a factory that creates the correct metadata\r\naccessors based on the configuration of the bookie. This is used by\r\nmultiple components, so should be constructed before these\r\ncomponents and passed in as a parameter.\r\n\r\nPreviously it was constructed by the bookie, and other components\r\ncalled into the bookie to get the instance, which broken encapsulation\r\nof the bookie and let to a bunch of ugly mocking.\r\n\r\nThis change also removes a circular dependency in the construction of\r\nthe RegistrationManager. Previously it was requiring a listener on\r\nconstruction, but the listener needed the bookie instance, so it all\r\nwent through a supplier. Now the listener is not needed at\r\nconstruction, but rather it is registered then the bookie starts.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds an injectable interface for cookie validation. The\r\nlegacy implementation of this interface is then injected into the\r\nBookieImpl on creation. The legacy implementation is code moved out of\r\nthe BookieImpl class itself.\r\n\r\nInjecting ledger storage is good for encapsulation, as it stops the\r\nledgerstorage depending on bookie behaviour. To that end, this change\r\nhighlights a couple of circular dependencies. Notably, between the\r\nledger storage and each of the statemanager, checkpointer and\r\ncheckpointState. I've removed each of these from\r\nLedgerStorage#initialize() so that is is clearer that these are\r\ncircular, and so that they can be fixed one by one.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note in this change is that the order of initialization\r\nhas changed.

Also extract the cookie validation into a separate\r\ninjectable interface.\r\n\r\nThe metadata driver is a factory that creates the correct metadata\r\naccessors based on the configuration of the bookie. This is used by\r\nmultiple components, so should be constructed before these\r\ncomponents and passed in as a parameter.\r\n\r\nPreviously it was constructed by the bookie, and other components\r\ncalled into the bookie to get the instance, which broken encapsulation\r\nof the bookie and let to a bunch of ugly mocking.\r\n\r\nThis change also removes a circular dependency in the construction of\r\nthe RegistrationManager. Previously it was requiring a listener on\r\nconstruction, but the listener needed the bookie instance, so it all\r\nwent through a supplier. Now the listener is not needed at\r\nconstruction, but rather it is registered then the bookie starts.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds an injectable interface for cookie validation. The\r\nlegacy implementation of this interface is then injected into the\r\nBookieImpl on creation. The legacy implementation is code moved out of\r\nthe BookieImpl class itself.\r\n\r\nInjecting ledger storage is good for encapsulation, as it stops the\r\nledgerstorage depending on bookie behaviour. To that end, this change\r\nhighlights a couple of circular dependencies. Notably, between the\r\nledger storage and each of the statemanager, checkpointer and\r\ncheckpointState. I've removed each of these from\r\nLedgerStorage#initialize() so that is is clearer that these are\r\ncircular, and so that they can be fixed one by one.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note in this change is that the order of initialization\r\nhas changed. LedgerStorage is initialized before the cookie\r\ncheck. This means that directory structure needs to be checked before\r\nthe cookie check. Previously it was done as part of the cookie\r\ncheck. Ledger storage must be initialized before the cookie check, as\r\nthe cookie check needs to use ledger storage to update limbo bits.\r\n\r\nBookieImpl is still responsible for shutting down the LedgerStorage. I\r\nwould have changed this, but it would have meant a lot of changes, as\r\nthere are good few ledger storage implementations.\r\n\r\n* Ensure RegistrationManagers are closed\r\n\r\n* Remove PortManager next port and args that set it\r\n\r\n* Fix checkstyle in tests\r\n\r\n* Add stacktrace to standalone test\r\n\r\n* Add --debug to standalone test\r\n\r\n* Add dynamic scaling to LocalBookKeeper\r\n\r\nSome tests in distributedlog require the ability\r\nto scale up and down bookies, using the\r\nLocalBookKeeper class but doing so using\r\nBookieServer directly. Now that components are\r\nconstructed outside of BookieServer, this scaling\r\nhad to be built into LocalBookKeeper itself so\r\nthe components could be constructed and

to get rid of CVE-2019-17571 (#2816)\n\n### Motivation\r\nUpgrades to log4j2 to get rid of CVE-2019-17571.  \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe migration of log4j has been done mainly taking the official

There exists a locations index rebuild command, this issue describes a new command targeted at the ledgers index.\r\n\r\nThis command should only be run when either the bookie is offline, or when in readonly mode to avoid data loss. Container based environments may not be able to make the bookie go offline while also allowing the shell or bkctl to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nThe db ledgers index rebuild op does the following:\r\n\r\n- scans all journal and entry log files to discover all ledger ids currently stored.\r\n- builds a new index where each ledger is fenced and has an empty master key set.\r\n- If all went well, replaces the original index with the new one\r\n\r\nThe bookie should then be restarted again (in normal mode) to load the rebuilt index. \r\n\r\nNotable stuff:\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting fencing each ledger is that there is no safe way of setting the fenced status based on metadata while the bookie is running. If the command is run when the bookie is in readonly mode, it can still serve fence requests and any fencing that occurs while the rebuild is occurring will be lost, which breaks the data safety guarantees of the BookKeeper protocol.

There exists a locations index rebuild command, this issue describes a new command targeted at the ledgers index.\r\n\r\nThis command should only be run when either the bookie is offline, or when in readonly mode to avoid data loss. Container based environments may not be able to make the bookie go offline while also allowing the shell or bkctl to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nThe db ledgers index rebuild op does the following:\r\n\r\n- scans all journal and entry log files to discover all ledger ids currently stored.\r\n- builds a new index where each ledger is fenced and has an empty master key set.\r\n- If all went well, replaces the original index with the new one\r\n\r\nThe bookie should then be restarted again (in normal mode) to load the rebuilt index. \r\n\r\nNotable stuff:\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting fencing each ledger is that there is no safe way of setting the fenced status based on metadata while the bookie is running. If the command is run when the bookie is in readonly mode, it can still serve fence requests and any fencing that occurs while the rebuild is occurring will be lost, which breaks the data safety guarantees of the BookKeeper protocol. Given also that the bookie should at least be in readonly mode (else offline), it is likely a member of the current ensemble of few ledgers so the impact should be minimal.\r\nThe reason for setting an empty master key is that firstly, an empty master key simply gets overwritten, so cannot cause an IllegalOpException. Secondly, if we use the password stored in metadata, then we need to be sure to use exactly the same digest algorithm as the client when it creates the ledgerKey, else the bookie will start failing all writes. This could potentially cause a problem in the future if the way the ledgerKey is generated changes (old clients would be incompatible after a ledgers index rebuild).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdds two new commands. \"rebuild-db-ledgers-index\" rebuilds the db ledgers index by scanning the journal and entry log files. \"check-db-ledgers-index\" performs a read scan of the db ledgers index, this can be used when corruption is suspected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n- a test of the new rebuild op\r\n- makes the Journal. listJournalIds() method public so that the command can iterate over the journal files.\r\n- rewords some printed statements in the LocationsIndexRebuildOp to make it clear which index it is rebuilding (given that there are two indexes in the DbLedgerStorage).\r\n\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #2774 from Vanlightly/rebuild-ledgers-index-op, closes #2773 and squashes the following commits:\n\n93bcf2e78 [Jack Vanlightly] Fix checkstyle\n5d679c8ef [Jack Vanlightly] Improved logging of ledgers index check and rebuild ops\na9789870f [Jack Vanlightly] Add db ledgers index rebuild op"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9/comments","author":{"login":"Vanlightly","id":5092576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTI1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5092576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly","html_url":"https://github.com/Vanlightly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd"}]},{"sha":"c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjpjNzIzNmFkYzNjYjY1OWU2NWFlNWNlNTNiNzE1NjU2OWQ3ZjUwZWJk","commit":{"author":{"name":"mauricebarnum","email":"mbarnum@splunk.com","date":"2021-09-08T22:25:33Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2021-09-08T22:25:33Z"},"message":"[STREAMSTORAGE] support an optional time to live (TTL) on a per table basis\n\n=== MOTIVIATION\r\n\r\nBookkeeper's state store is often used, especially through Pulsar\r\nfunctions, to store processing state in a streaming application which\r\nrequire persistent short term storage.

After failure we will restart the storage container again.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue during my testing and was able confirm that we are able\r\nto recover from

TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to Epoll channel config\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAdded `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` in Epoll channel config to limit the time a connection is left sending keepalives to a non-responding Bookie.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe original issue reported that in scenarios where Bookies may go down unexpectedly and change their IP (e.g., Kubernetes), the Bookkeeper client may be left for some time attempting to connect with the old IP of the restarted Bookie (see #2482 for details). To prevent this problem from happening (in Epoll channels), we introduce the following changes:\r\n- Epoll channels are now configured with `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT`. This parameter rules over the underlying TCP keepalive configuration (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5482), which may be defaulted to retry for too long depending on the environment (e.g., 10-15 minutes in our experience).\r\n- To prevent adding more configuration parameters, the existing `clientConnectTimeoutMillis` value in `ClientConfiguration` is the one used to set `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` due to its similarity.\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\n\r\nWe have reproduced the original testing environment in which this problem appears consistently:\r\n- Cluster with 4 Bookies and 3 Kubernetes nodes, in addition to https://pravega.io which uses the Bookkeeper client.\r\n- Deployed an application to do IO to Pravega (and therefore, to Bookkeeper).\r\n- Periodically shut down a Kubernetes node, so Bookkeeper pods on it are restarted as well.\r\n\r\nConsidering this test procedure, without the proposed PR we consistently observe Bookkeeper clients getting stuck trying to contact with old IPs from Bookies. With this change, we confirmed via logs that the configuration change takes place and we have not been able to reproduce the original problem so far after performing multiple node reboots.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2482\r\n\n\nReviewers: Flavio Junqueira <fpj@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2761 from RaulGracia/issue-2482-close-idle-bookie-connection, closes #2482","tree":{"sha":"01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/c8d4086697f85c9093f4da2c907a13e17c198914","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJhJjIOCRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAA8S8IAJ4SY9Qq5oOSfOhZSHTZYbPU\nWtdQImJGNInhYiAClq1dj9jNoxaUOO+VwLpWess6Nju9yDRa2qts/zriEx7/ZeTT\n195TFv9ZEAcHcr218VpR9cv2jKgD+IQKJXYAS4osP8lzrBE4HooZvHV4KPIF4jCM\nrfIn2AUvwDyMQruTUhTZxejfqDgjMUa8A1j85xh6jPn2ZYcg74ZGsIGP8jKN2FL+\nD2pZtEr26YZGg806Xqf7bmwOepWr8JXcgB2i0/5QRE0Md55qF/KjmX+8EZPogYlP\npu1u/EUHiRyrHD5Juuuv/NVzVW5YmZJyFjscwY9sEPS65y9UvDsZmAtMW6CAts8=\n=uPBY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8\nparent 393834b6131423c0b7c5d7baa54b1bd867afe72a\nauthor Raúl Gracia <raul.gracia@emc.com> 1629893134 +0200\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1629893134 +0200\n\nISSUE #2482: Added TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to Epoll channel config\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAdded `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` in Epoll channel config to limit the time a connection is left sending keepalives to a non-responding Bookie.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe original issue reported that in scenarios where Bookies may go down unexpectedly and change their IP (e.g., Kubernetes), the Bookkeeper client may be left for some time attempting to connect with the old IP of the restarted Bookie (see #2482 for details).
