`tests/scripts/src/test/bash/gradle`\r\n- Added these modules to the build\r\n    - `bookkeeper-http:servlet-http-server` \r\n    - `metadata-drivers:etcd`\r\n    - `tests:backward-compat:*`\r\n    - `tests:shaded:*`\r\n    - `stream:bk-grpc-name-resolver`\r\n- DL shading process is now performed (before it didn't build any jar)\r\n- Groovy tests (`tests:backward-compat:*`) now are triggered by the build/tests itself; with Maven, there is a \"runner\" project (`tests/integration-tests-base-groovy`); in Gradle is useless so it is skipped\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test\r\n\r\n- Both `bin/bookkeper

the stacktrace.\r\n\r\n(This problem is due to [#2813](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2813).)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdd error handling to readLedgerMetadata in over-replicated ledger GC in order to suppress the stacktrace.\r\n"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/bd5c50bf331c28e6a9db2b8d2b186b86342dbd6b","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/bd5c50bf331c28e6a9db2b8d2b186b86342dbd6b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/bd5c50bf331c28e6a9db2b8d2b186b86342dbd6b/comments","author":{"login":"shustsud","id":51769018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzY5MDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51769018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud","html_url":"https://github.com/shustsud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shustsud/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"746f9f6ff5f54203a6f1c25b7d0f02642455ea04","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/746f9f6ff5f54203a6f1c25b7d0f02642455ea04","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/746f9f6ff5f54203a6f1c25b7d0f02642455ea04"}]},{"sha":"746f9f6ff5f54203a6f1c25b7d0f02642455ea04","node_id":"C_kwDOABgMFNoAKDc0NmY5ZjZmZjVmNTQyMDNhNmYxYzI1YjdkMGYwMjY0MjQ1NWVhMDQ","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo

to get rid of CVE-2019-17571 (#2816)\n\n### Motivation\r\nUpgrades to log4j2 to get rid of CVE-2019-17571.  \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe migration of log4j has been done mainly taking the official

There exists a locations index rebuild command, this issue describes a new command targeted at the ledgers index.\r\n\r\nThis command should only be run when either the bookie is offline, or when in readonly mode to avoid data loss. Container based environments may not be able to make the bookie go offline while also allowing the shell or bkctl to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nThe db ledgers index rebuild op does the following:\r\n\r\n- scans all journal and entry log files to discover all ledger ids currently stored.\r\n- builds a new index where each ledger is fenced and has an empty master key set.\r\n- If all went well, replaces the original index with the new one\r\n\r\nThe bookie should then be restarted again (in normal mode) to load the rebuilt index. \r\n\r\nNotable stuff:\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting fencing each ledger is that there is no safe way of setting the fenced status based on metadata while the bookie is running. If the command is run when the bookie is in readonly mode, it can still serve fence requests and any fencing that occurs while the rebuild is occurring will be lost, which breaks the data safety guarantees of the BookKeeper protocol.

There exists a locations index rebuild command, this issue describes a new command targeted at the ledgers index.\r\n\r\nThis command should only be run when either the bookie is offline, or when in readonly mode to avoid data loss. Container based environments may not be able to make the bookie go offline while also allowing the shell or bkctl to perform the operation.\r\n\r\nThe db ledgers index rebuild op does the following:\r\n\r\n- scans all journal and entry log files to discover all ledger ids currently stored.\r\n- builds a new index where each ledger is fenced and has an empty master key set.\r\n- If all went well, replaces the original index with the new one\r\n\r\nThe bookie should then be restarted again (in normal mode) to load the rebuilt index. \r\n\r\nNotable stuff:\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting fencing each ledger is that there is no safe way of setting the fenced status based on metadata while the bookie is running. If the command is run when the bookie is in readonly mode, it can still serve fence requests and any fencing that occurs while the rebuild is occurring will be lost, which breaks the data safety guarantees of the BookKeeper protocol. Given also that the bookie should at least be in readonly mode (else offline), it is likely a member of the current ensemble of few ledgers so the impact should be minimal.\r\nThe reason for setting an empty master key is that firstly, an empty master key simply gets overwritten, so cannot cause an IllegalOpException. Secondly, if we use the password stored in metadata, then we need to be sure to use exactly the same digest algorithm as the client when it creates the ledgerKey, else the bookie will start failing all writes. This could potentially cause a problem in the future if the way the ledgerKey is generated changes (old clients would be incompatible after a ledgers index rebuild).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdds two new commands. \"rebuild-db-ledgers-index\" rebuilds the db ledgers index by scanning the journal and entry log files. \"check-db-ledgers-index\" performs a read scan of the db ledgers index, this can be used when corruption is suspected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n- a test of the new rebuild op\r\n- makes the Journal. listJournalIds() method public so that the command can iterate over the journal files.\r\n- rewords some printed statements in the LocationsIndexRebuildOp to make it clear which index it is rebuilding (given that there are two indexes in the DbLedgerStorage).\r\n\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #2774 from Vanlightly/rebuild-ledgers-index-op, closes #2773 and squashes the following commits:\n\n93bcf2e78 [Jack Vanlightly] Fix checkstyle\n5d679c8ef [Jack Vanlightly] Improved logging of ledgers index check and rebuild ops\na9789870f [Jack Vanlightly] Add db ledgers index rebuild op"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/0b93249d25419de9714f22c396d371940be448f9/comments","author":{"login":"Vanlightly","id":5092576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTI1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5092576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly","html_url":"https://github.com/Vanlightly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vanlightly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd"}]},{"sha":"c7236adc3cb659e65ae5ce53b7156569d7f50ebd","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjpjNzIzNmFkYzNjYjY1OWU2NWFlNWNlNTNiNzE1NjU2OWQ3ZjUwZWJk","commit":{"author":{"name":"mauricebarnum","email":"mbarnum@splunk.com","date":"2021-09-08T22:25:33Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2021-09-08T22:25:33Z"},"message":"[STREAMSTORAGE] support an optional time to live (TTL) on a per table basis\n\n=== MOTIVIATION\r\n\r\nBookkeeper's state store is often used, especially through Pulsar\r\nfunctions, to store processing state in a streaming application which\r\nrequire persistent short term storage.

After failure we will restart the storage container again.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue during my testing and was able confirm that we are able\r\nto recover from

TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to Epoll channel config\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAdded `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` in Epoll channel config to limit the time a connection is left sending keepalives to a non-responding Bookie.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe original issue reported that in scenarios where Bookies may go down unexpectedly and change their IP (e.g., Kubernetes), the Bookkeeper client may be left for some time attempting to connect with the old IP of the restarted Bookie (see #2482 for details). To prevent this problem from happening (in Epoll channels), we introduce the following changes:\r\n- Epoll channels are now configured with `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT`. This parameter rules over the underlying TCP keepalive configuration (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5482), which may be defaulted to retry for too long depending on the environment (e.g., 10-15 minutes in our experience).\r\n- To prevent adding more configuration parameters, the existing `clientConnectTimeoutMillis` value in `ClientConfiguration` is the one used to set `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` due to its similarity.\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\n\r\nWe have reproduced the original testing environment in which this problem appears consistently:\r\n- Cluster with 4 Bookies and 3 Kubernetes nodes, in addition to https://pravega.io which uses the Bookkeeper client.\r\n- Deployed an application to do IO to Pravega (and therefore, to Bookkeeper).\r\n- Periodically shut down a Kubernetes node, so Bookkeeper pods on it are restarted as well.\r\n\r\nConsidering this test procedure, without the proposed PR we consistently observe Bookkeeper clients getting stuck trying to contact with old IPs from Bookies. With this change, we confirmed via logs that the configuration change takes place and we have not been able to reproduce the original problem so far after performing multiple node reboots.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2482\r\n\n\nReviewers: Flavio Junqueira <fpj@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2761 from RaulGracia/issue-2482-close-idle-bookie-connection, closes #2482","tree":{"sha":"01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/c8d4086697f85c9093f4da2c907a13e17c198914","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJhJjIOCRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAA8S8IAJ4SY9Qq5oOSfOhZSHTZYbPU\nWtdQImJGNInhYiAClq1dj9jNoxaUOO+VwLpWess6Nju9yDRa2qts/zriEx7/ZeTT\n195TFv9ZEAcHcr218VpR9cv2jKgD+IQKJXYAS4osP8lzrBE4HooZvHV4KPIF4jCM\nrfIn2AUvwDyMQruTUhTZxejfqDgjMUa8A1j85xh6jPn2ZYcg74ZGsIGP8jKN2FL+\nD2pZtEr26YZGg806Xqf7bmwOepWr8JXcgB2i0/5QRE0Md55qF/KjmX+8EZPogYlP\npu1u/EUHiRyrHD5Juuuv/NVzVW5YmZJyFjscwY9sEPS65y9UvDsZmAtMW6CAts8=\n=uPBY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 01db192464edddad17c6c8a01c2c2cf40ef09ad8\nparent 393834b6131423c0b7c5d7baa54b1bd867afe72a\nauthor Raúl Gracia <raul.gracia@emc.com> 1629893134 +0200\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1629893134 +0200\n\nISSUE #2482: Added TCP_USER_TIMEOUT to Epoll channel config\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAdded `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` in Epoll channel config to limit the time a connection is left sending keepalives to a non-responding Bookie.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe original issue reported that in scenarios where Bookies may go down unexpectedly and change their IP (e.g., Kubernetes), the Bookkeeper client may be left for some time attempting to connect with the old IP of the restarted Bookie (see #2482 for details).

incompatible issue (#2740)\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nMore details are provided in [Pulsar # 10937](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/10937).\r\n\r\nIn #2631, the default BouncyCastle

book keeper cluster test case\n\n### Motivation\r\nBookKeeperClusterTestCase has historically exposed its members to all\r\nsubclasses, which would then manipulate them in many ways. There was\r\nan array of objects for configurations, bookieServers, autorecovery,\r\nwhich implicit linking between the objects based on maps and indices.\r\nIndividual subclasses manipulated these arrays.\r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to add any dependency injection on the objects\r\nmanaged by BookKeeperClusterTestCase as the objects.

There was\r\nan array of objects for configurations, bookieServers, autorecovery,\r\nwhich implicit linking between the objects based on maps and indices.\r\nIndividual subclasses manipulated these arrays.\r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to add any dependency injection on the objects\r\nmanaged by BookKeeperClusterTestCase as the objects. To add DI, we\r\nneed each object to have a bunch of other objects associated with\r\nit. For example, for each Bookie, we need to create the\r\nJournal.
