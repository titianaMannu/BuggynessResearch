However the scripts and configurations for dlog and table-service modules are still in their own modules. It is inconvenient and confusing. This change mainly refactor current bookkeeper script to make it reusable for other modules.\n\n*Code Change*\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n- abstract the common logic in `bin/bookkeeper` to `bin/common.sh`. These common logics include:\n   * common definitions on environment variables, such jvm settings, bk conf, log4j conf, classpath and such.\n   * common functions can be reusable, such as find jars, add maven dependencies.\n- simplify `bin/bookkeeper` and `bin/bookkeeper-cli` by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n- remove `stream/distributedlog/core/bin/dlog` to `bin/dlog` and simplify it by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n\n*Tests*\n\nMost of the changes in this PR are tests to ensure this script refactor is done correctly.\n\n- introduced a module `tests/scripts` for testing all the bash scripts in bookkeeper project. This module uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) for testing bash scripts. This gives a good test coverage on `bin/common.sh`.\n\n- add a few CLI smoketests under `tests/integration/smoke` to smoke test all CLI tools, including `bin/bookkeeper shell`, `bin/bookkeeper-cli` and `bin/dlog`. This makes sure all the CLI scripts work well after refactor.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1407 from sijie/include_dlog_library","tree":{"sha":"aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312"}]},{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5MjU5MTczM2M4Yjc3OGY2M2NkNzFhMDBiMmM3ZWQyYzY5YzQxMzEy","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1403: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown on readLastAddConfirmedAndEntry\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThere are two bugs in `ReadLastAddConfirmedAndEntry`:\n\n1) a regression was introduced by #657. the long poll read op is attempting to long-poll reading lac. since lac is stored across ensemble, so the retry logic assumes it will attempt over all the bookies in the ensemble. however #657 use a `write-quorum-size` write set for tracking those attempts. this leads to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException reported at #1403.

The integrate tests added in this PR can also catch this issue.\n\ndisclaim: twitter uses long poll reads but never uses `ensembleSize > writeQuorumSize`. so this is not a problem for dlog users.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- introduce a `getWriteSetForLongPoll` call that uses `ensembleSize` for building the write set. this would address problem 1)\n- fix the assignment of

http server\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrently metrics provider and http admin endpoint are isolated due to the way how things are modularized.\nThis requires two ports to be used, one is for metrics provider to expose metrics, while the other one is used by\nhttp admin endpoint for expose admin endpoints.\n\nWhen implementing a bookkeeper operator on k8s, it becomes confusing on managing those ports and do health checks.\nIt would be good to allow export metrics in same http admin endpoint if it is enabled.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- Introduce a method `writeAllMetrics` in stats provider to allow stats provider exporting metrics.\n- Add a `MetricsService` in bookie http service and export stats provider's metrics under `/metrics` endpoint.\n\nThis

In this case we are simulating a regular sync'd write to the journal choosen for the ledger.\n\nAuthor: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\nAuthor: eolivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, JV Jujjuri <vjujjuri@salesforce.com>\n\nThis closes #1375 from eolivelli/bp14-simple-forceledger","tree":{"sha":"546606a9ad1fb7bcfebcc449ccfa80fc6a764532","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/546606a9ad1fb7bcfebcc449ccfa80fc6a764532"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6/comments","author":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5"}]},{"sha":"8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo4ZTc1ODNiNGM2OTFkYzQ0YmI5MDU3YTJmZTQ3MmE0NDE4NDM0NmE1","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-07T08:50:29Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-07T08:50:29Z"},"message":"[TABLE SERVICE] a zk based storage container controller\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThe original storage container \"controller\" was written in helix. The helix controller's placement is kind of not assuming any properties of shared storage. however the table service is leverage bookkeeper's as its segment/log store. the table service is built in a more `stateless` way, where a storage container can be moved between servers in a much lightweight way.\n\nAlso helix codebase is a bit large, if we eventually going to eliminate zookeeper, the cost of switching it off helix will be much expensive. so this PR is introducing a simple zk based controller for assigning storage containers to servers.\n\n*Solution*\n\nIn this zk base solution, it is comprised of 3 parts: server registration, cluster & storage controller, storage container manager.\n\n**registration**\n\nthis solution leverages existing registration client/manager interfaces. so each storage server registers itself under `/stream/servers/available`.\n\n**cluster & storage controller**\n\nA storage server is elected as a the leader, which runs a ClusterController. The cluster controller reads cluster metadata from zookeeper (the cluster metadata includes like how many containers available in the cluster), and use a storage controller to compute an assignment plan as the ideal state for container assignment mapping, and then update the assignment mapping to zookeeper under `/stream/assignment`.\n\n**storage container manager**\n\nEach storage server runs a storage container manager, which watches the assignment plan in zookeeper. The cluster controller updates the assignment plan. Once it receives watches/updates from the assignment plan that computed by cluster controller, the storage container manager will align itself to the ideal assignment map by starting/stopping storage containers.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1392 from

This new \"FastCodahaleMetricsProvider\" brings a new timer implementation \"FastTimer\", which extends Codahale's Timer class, provides an identical API, is registered in Codahale's timer registry, and can be queried through the existing JettyServices implementation. FastTimer provides similar functionality as Codahale's default timer, but is significantly faster and (nearly) garbage free.\n\nThe improvements of FastTimer over Codahale default Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs are:\n* entirely garbage-free Timer updates (only snapshot creations when querying a timer allocate a small number of Java objects)\n* 3x faster Timer updates (i.e. 3x shorter code-path to update a timer)\n* half the memory footprint (in default configuration)\n\nFastTimer reduces GC pause times in our experiments as described in Issue 1363 by half (same as entirely deactivating all timers).\n\nThe primary functional differences between FastTimer and Codahale default Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs are:\n* FastTimer keeps values for a fixed, configurable time period (default: 60 seconds) rather than exponentially decaying them\n* FastTimer bucketizes event times rather than storing discrete values. Percentile values depend on the bucket resolution.\n\nDesign Considerations\n---------------------\n\nThe design goals of this timer implementation are for it to be\n - fast (i.e. few instructions to update a timer)\n - scalable (i.e. little synchronization cost for concurrent timer updates)\n - garbage-free for timer updates (i.e. no object allocation for timer updates)\n - space-efficient (i.e. as little memory footprint as possible while achieving first three goals)\n - provide similar functionality as Codahale's default timers with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs\n\nThis implementation provides rate and response times over a configurable sliding time window. Data\nis stored in upfront allocated circular arrays, in which each array element holds data\nfor one second. Data is overwritten in a circular fashion without the allocation of new data\nstructures and is therefore garbage-free for all timer updates.\n\nThis implementation does not store individual response times, but instead allocates bucketized counters\nupfront, which are incremented for any event falling into a particular response time bucket. A\nfine-grained bucket definition (intended for capturing successsful events) and a coarse-grained\nbucket definition (intended to capture failure or timed-out events) are provided.\n\nTo improve scalability of concurrent timer updates, most data structures are replicated HASH_SIZE\ntimes, and calling threads updating a timer are hashed to individual instances. Performance tests\n(see below) have shown that this implementation is light-weight enough to achieve slightly better\nscalability than Codahale's default timers even without hashing, and can further improve scalability\nif hashing is used.\n\nTrading off performance and scalability vs. memory footprint, we need to be conservative in the hash\nsize we chose. Different flavors of this timer implementation have been evaluated using JMH\nmicro-benchmarks (see microbenchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/stats/TimerBenchmark.java),\ncomparing implementations of FastTimer with a time window of 60 seconds and\n- (DEV1)   a HASH_SIZE of 3 for all data structures (meters, counters, min/max, and response time buckets)\n- (DEV2)   a HASH_SIZE of 1 for all data structures (meters, counters, min/max, and response time buckets)\n- (FINAL)  a HASH_SIZE of 3 for meters, counters, min/max, and no hashing for response time buckets\nto the default timer implementation\n- (BASE-E) Codahale Timer with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoir (default as used by bookkeeper code)\n- (BASE-T) Codahale Timer with SlidingTimeWindowReservoir configured to 60 seconds\n- (BASE-S) Codahale Timer with SlidingWindowReservoir configured to hold 100,000 events.\n\nBased on results below, implementation (FINAL) was chosen as the final FastTimer implementation, as it\nachieves nearly the same throughput as (DEV1) at nearly the same memory footprint as (DEV2), and\nultimately achieves roughly 3x higher throughput and scalability that Codahale's default implementation\nat around half the memory footprint.\n\nThe following results have been collected on an eight core x86 server running at 3.2 GHz (updated\ntimers are shared across 4 threads):\n\n```\nConfig   Timer Impl             Timers   Threads      ops/ms   Alloc B/op   Kb/TimerPair\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

instantiate a\nCodahale MetricsServlet, which instantiates a Codahale MetricsModule, which only serializes\ntimers that are instances of Timer class into the json output stream). Unless we wanted to\nreimplement or override all these base classes, we can't just implement Codahale's Metered and Sampling\ninterfaces. Instead we have to extend its Timer class, even though we're not using any of its\ninherited functionality or data structures. The inherited (unused) member variables of Codahale Timer\nconsume slightly less than 512 byte per FastTimer (measured around 425 byte in Codahale 3.1).\nAbove memory footprint results include ~ 1 kb of inherited (unused) data structures, which comprise\naround 1% of FastTimer's overall memory footprint.\n\nIn terms of functionality, FastTimer provides the same functionality as Codahale's timers\n(in default configuration with ExponentiallyDecayingReservoirs), with the following exceptions:\n- Statistics are kept for a fixed amount of time (rather than exponentially decayed), by\n  default 60 seconds. As a consequence, getMeanRate(), getOneMinuteRate(),  getFiveMinuteRate()\n  and getFifteenMinuteRate() all return the same value if FastTimer is configured to use a\n  60 second time window.\n- FastTimer and FastSnapshot only record bucketized instead of discrete response times. As a\n  consequence, the accuracy of percentiles depends on bucket granularity. FastSnapshot also\n  can't return discrete values: getValues() returns an empty array, and size returns 0.\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Michael <nmichael@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1364 from nicmichael/FastTimer, closes #1363","tree":{"sha":"67fc8b3f65c5e3e954e781e35b977023b89c3aa8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/67fc8b3f65c5e3e954e781e35b977023b89c3aa8"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/ed3b0105d0e1adbb118641cc39f886659d140361","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/ed3b0105d0e1adbb118641cc39f886659d140361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/ed3b0105d0e1adbb118641cc39f886659d140361","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/ed3b0105d0e1adbb118641cc39f886659d140361/comments","author":{"login":"nicmichael","id":27270046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjcwMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27270046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael","html_url":"https://github.com/nicmichael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"e021ac31cb1acb8de6d4161a618e76127d04d1c8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/e021ac31cb1acb8de6d4161a618e76127d04d1c8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/e021ac31cb1acb8de6d4161a618e76127d04d1c8"}]},{"sha":"e021ac31cb1acb8de6d4161a618e76127d04d1c8","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjplMDIxYWMzMWNiMWFjYjhkZTZkNDE2MWE2MThlNzYxMjdkMDRkMWM4","commit":{"author":{"name":"Nicolas Michael","email":"nmichael@salesforce.com","date":"2018-04-24T10:17:32Z"},"committer":{"name":"Enrico Olivelli","email":"eolivelli@apache.org","date":"2018-04-24T10:17:32Z"},"message":"Issue #791: Eliminate byte[] copies in AddEntry code path\n\nThe AddEntry code path in Bookkeeper Client performs several copies of the send buffer before sending it out to bookies, which not only costs CPU cycles for array copying, but also drives up object allocation rate and thus increases young GC frequency.\n\nCurrently, the send buffer is prepared by DigestManager.computeDigestAndPackageForSending(), which wraps the netty ByteBuf containing the data together with a (direct) header buffer into a ByteBufList. So far, we haven't yet allocated or copied any new buffers. But in order to send the buffer to the bookies, PendingAddOp.safeRun() will invoke sendWriteRequest() for each bookie in the write set, which will eventually invoke PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() for each bookie. In here, we are now allocating two new byte[] and copying the buffer twice per bookie for V3 protocol with protobuf:\n    byte[] toSendArray = toSend.toArray();      // 1st byte[] allocation and copy\n    .setBody(ByteString.copyFrom(toSendArray)); // 2nd byte[] allocation and copy\nIf for example we're using a write set size of 3, then we allocate 6 byte arrays and copy the same buffer 6 times.\n\nAll 6 copies can be eliminated if DigestManager.computeDigestAndPackageForSending() would return a ByteBuf (or ByteBufList) that is backed by an array, which we can access and use without further copying it. PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() could then wrap this array into a protobuf ByteString without performing any additional copies.\n\nThis change eliminates all byte[] allocations and copies in PCBC by:\n1. allocating a new (pooled) array-backed heap ByteBuf for header, digest, and data in DigestManager.computeDigestAndPackageForSending()\n2. copying the data payload into this newly allocated ByteBuf and returning it wrapped into a ByteBufList of size 1 (instead of header + body separately)\n3. enhancing ByteBufList to give access to the underlying array if it consists of only a single ByteBuf that's backed by an array\n4. extracting the underlying array in PerChannelBookieClient.addEntry() from ByteBufList and wrapping it into protobuf ByteString without copying it.\n\nWith this change, no more object allocations are required in this code path. DigestManager uses a pooled array (1). We're adding one arraycopy in (2) compared to the original code path, trading this against the allocations and copies we save later on.. Later steps, in particular step (4), is free of object allocation and array copies.\nAs a result, the object allocation rate in the AddEntry code path is reduced significantly. In case of a write set size of 3, it is reduced from 6 to 0. This translates into much less frequent young generation garbage collections (in my experiments with write-heavy workload by ~4x overall).\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Michael

However most of the tests and tools are still assuming `zkServers`.\nThis causes a problem if people configures `metadataServiceUri`, some of the admin tools don't actually work.\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis change changes bookkeeper to use `metadataServiceUri` in all the possible places and provides methods to resolve zkServers\nand zkLedgersRootPath from metadata service uri. This ensures:\n\n1) if users configure `metadataServiceUri`, all the tools would work properly.\n2) if users doesn't configure `metadataServiceUri` and still use `zkServers` and `zkLedgersRootPath`, all the tools would still work.\n\n*Changes*\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n- deprecated direct usage of `getZkServers`, `setZkServers`, `getZkLedgersRootPath`, `setZkLedgersRootPath, `getZkAvailablePath` at AbstractConfiguration\n- provide util methods `resolveZkServers` and `resolverZkLedgersRootPath` in `ZkMetadataDriverBase` for resolving zookeeper specific settings from metadata service uri\n- change the tools to use `getMetadataServiceUri`\n- change the tests to use `getMetadataServiceUri` to ensure code coverage\n\n*NOTES*\n\nThere are a few places still using `getZkServers`, `setZkServers`. those are hard to change at this moment.\n\nRelated Issue:\n- #1335\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia

DbLedgerStorage\n\nIn normal conditions, the max throughput that a bookie can sustain is mostly determined by how fast we can write entries on the journal.\n\nIf we assume a *very* fast journal, for example using multiple journal threads and setting `journalSyncData=false` or with the journal on a RAM disk (there are some cases in which it might make sense), then the LedgerStorage becomes the \"bottleneck\". We need to be able to flush data on disk faster than the incoming rate, otherwise the write cache will get full and then we have to apply backpressure.\n\nIn different testing scenario, the bottleneck has become the LedgerStoarge flush/checkpoint because it's done by a single thread.\n\nFor smaller entries (1KB) the limit is ~250 K write/s and the limitation is due to preparing a batch with the offsets to write into rocksdb. Each insertion in the batch needs to cross JNI boundaries and that is expensive.\n\nFor bigger entries (10KB), the limit is ~50K write/s (or 500MB /s). This mostly because the single flush thread cannot drive 100% IO utilization on the disks (since it's doing the rest of work). Raw disk writes in that test environment (12 HDDs) could reach 1.4GB/s.\n\nThis change is only relative to DbLedgerStorage and it's a simple refactoring that, when configured with multiple directories, it will hash a ledger into a certain directory. Each directory is flushed independently on its own thread.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1289 from merlimat/db-storage-multiple-dirs","tree":{"sha":"65cc36770b9709cebb63029a98c30270bf83a1e4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/65cc36770b9709cebb63029a98c30270bf83a1e4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4939416c68f20c990d5c98ee19d59ba662f1b4a0/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0"}]},{"sha":"ea1a75c0622a93abbd16fd71820f3c0cb5fc3ab0","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjplYTFhNzVjMDYyMmE5M2FiYmQxNmZkNzE4MjBmM2MwY2I1ZmMzYWIw","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T23:39:28Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-04-06T23:39:28Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1316: A bookie with non-writable dirs should be able to start in readonly mode\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Problem*\n\nBookie failed to start when it doesn't have non-writable dirs.

OrderedSafeExecutor and OrderedScheduler\n\nAs outlined in https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/102383ea42f473f36720637e41af0ee83fc38d9f992736e0d1a7f985%3Cdev.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E\n\nright now `OrderedSafeExecutor` is implemented on top of `OrderedScheduler`.  There are few problems with this approach that are causing impact on performance:\n\n 1. `OrderedScheduler` is a `ScheduledExecutorService` which uses a priority queue for tasks. The priority queue has a single mutex for both publishers/consumers on the queue\n 2. There are many objects created for each task submission, due to listenable future decorators\n\nSince in all cases in critical write/read path we don't need delay task execution or futures, we should try to have a light weight execution for that.\n\n### Modifications\n\n * Inverted the hierarchy between `OrderedSafeExecutor` and `OrderedScheduler`. Now the base class is `OrderedSafeExecutor` and the other extends from it, since it provides additional methods.\n * Moved `OrderedSafeExecutor` in `bookkeeper-common` since `OrderedScheduler` was already there.\n * Moved `OrderedSafeGenericCallback` in its own file, since it needs to be in `bookkeeper-server` module at this point.\n * Changed some method names from `submitOrdered()` into `executeOrdered()` to be consistent with JDK name (`submit()` returns a future while `execute()` returns void).\n * Changed `BookKeeper` instance of `scheduler` into `OrderedScheduler` so that the few cases which were using the `mainWorkerPool` could be easily converted to use the scheduler instead.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Andrey Yegorov <None>, Enrico Olivelli

Multiple threads can be be in read mode in the critical section, though they have contention when they're entering/exiting the section.\n\nAdditionally, the Java implementation of read/write lock is creating and destroying a lot of objects when that contention happens.\n\nMy understanding of the code is that we don't need to acquire the read lock in that point. The reason is that, we are already acquiring the lock in the `lookupClient()` method, although only if the pool is null. Additionally, when `Bookkeeper.close()` is invoked all PCBC will be set to closed as well, so it will not be possibile to create a new connection.\n\nAll the line changes in the patch are just removing the readLock acquire and try/finally, and reducing the indentation level.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1292 from merlimat/bookie-client-rw-lock and squashes the following commits:\n\n2104a3aa7 [Matteo Merli] Converted anonymous classes into lambdas\ncabad14e5 [Matteo Merli] Avoid acquiring closeLock.readLock() on every add/read operation","tree":{"sha":"a40ef6bac4d902ea0d08b1976477bb57a125f371","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/a40ef6bac4d902ea0d08b1976477bb57a125f371"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/9df8dac295c875ee3395d78a2bab3cda0c3c9ddd/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2"}]},{"sha":"d8c95885136b46013ae942b3d32ae0ea66866dd2","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjpkOGM5NTg4NTEzNmI0NjAxM2FlOTQyYjNkMzJhZTBlYTY2ODY2ZGQy","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-03-29T13:17:15Z"},"committer":{"name":"Jia Zhai","email":"zhaijia@apache.org","date":"2018-03-29T13:17:15Z"},"message":"Use reflection based CRC32 to pass direct memory pointer\n\nThe crc update with the bytebuffer is very expensive, especially in netty > 4.1.12.\n\n```java\ncrc.get().update(data.nioBuffer());\n```\n\nConverting a direct`ByteBuf` into a `ByteBuffer` with `data.nioBuffer()` is actually resorting to allocating an unpooled `DirectByteBuffer` which is actually killing the GC (since direct memory is freed when the `DirectByteBuffer` instances are GCed, but the pauses are > 1 second).\n\nThis is an adaptation of a change from Yahoo branch at https://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/commit/6c01ca2921a998f3bf2e85cacb27867773e7ea28\n\nInitially I though this change was not needed anymore in 4.7 codebase, and that is true for the CRC32c variant.

`testGetMissingPathsRecursive`\n\n*Solution*\n\nAdd unique suffix to \"/path\" for each test case to avoid conflicts\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang

One thing to note is that\nI've made a copy of the close and closeAsync methods in the\nWriteHandle interface, so that the ReadHandle and Handle javadoc for\nthese methods do not have to talk about what it means to close/seal a\nledger.\n\nAnother change is that I've removed the SneakyThrows from close, that\nwould have also been needed on the other sync methods. Instead, I pass a\nexception handler to FutureUtils which generates a BKException.\n\n[1]

If concurrent loading happens, there might be a FileInfo loaded into the map after get-check. This can cause incorrect reference count on FileInfo.\n\n2) FileLoader is doing I/O operation which happens under a giant write lock.\n\n3) assert is typically not recommended since it is disabled at production runtime typically.\n\n*Changes*\n\n- Check whether fileinfo exists or not after getting write lock and before put\n- Move any I/O operations out of write lock\n- release the new FileInfo if concurrent puts happen\n- remove the usage of assert\n\nBeside that, switch to use ConcurrentLongHashMap to avoid boxing and unboxing.\n\nRelated Issues:\n\n#913 #832\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo

DbLedgerStorage\n\nThis PR contain 2 changes that are much related to each other.\n\n1. Changed DbLedgerStorage write cache read-write lock into a `StampedLock`\n   Main reason for using `StampedLock` is that this lock is always taken as a \"read\" lock, when putting entries in the the cache. It is protecting for the swapping of the write cache when the flush is triggered. Most of the time, we have many threads acquiring the read-lock. `StampedLock` is better in this scenario because there isn't any contention in the optimistic path (just a double volatile read).\n\n2. Have a configurable throttle timing when the write cache is really full.\n    If we try to write faster than we can put data in the storage device, eventually both write caches will get full and we have to throttle writes. Added here a setting to configure the amount of time to block the thread (who's calling `Bookie.addEntry()`, it could be IO thread or a addEntryWorker depending on configuration).\n   After the timeout, if we still weren't able to flush the write cache and insert the current entry, bookie will reject the write operation, without logging but rather using a counter to keep track of it.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1280 from merlimat/db-storage-stamped-lock","tree":{"sha":"11da5fee271d49dc981f813b0b1c569d03ac7c53","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/11da5fee271d49dc981f813b0b1c569d03ac7c53"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/1496ebf8cd0753a92be384e019b7ed6ec03e1ad8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1496ebf8cd0753a92be384e019b7ed6ec03e1ad8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1496ebf8cd0753a92be384e019b7ed6ec03e1ad8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1496ebf8cd0753a92be384e019b7ed6ec03e1ad8/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6edbdd905dbb1a20a7e9282047c6a255d1e9f527","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/6edbdd905dbb1a20a7e9282047c6a255d1e9f527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/6edbdd905dbb1a20a7e9282047c6a255d1e9f527"}]},{"sha":"6edbdd905dbb1a20a7e9282047c6a255d1e9f527","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo2ZWRiZGQ5MDVkYmIxYTIwYTdlOTI4MjA0N2M2YTI1NWQxZTlmNTI3","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-03-21T00:02:39Z"},"committer":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2018-03-21T00:02:39Z"},"message":"Fixed DbStorage write cache segment index computation\n\nWhen the write cache was merged from `yahoo-4.3` branch into master, an improvement went in around computing the the write cache segment index (doing shift instead of division) and that introduced a problem.\n\nThe write cache is broken into multiple segments (since buffers in JVM can only be at most 2GB).
