early-exiting problem.\n- we run two installs. one is the default install by travis, the other one is install with apache-rat/spotbug checks in script section, which make the build slow.\n- travis_retry and travis_wait spread across different commands in the script section\n\n*Solution*\n\n- move build logic into a bash script file and invoke the script\n- skip install section in travis\n\n*Result*\n\nThis reduces travis build time by 10+ mins and make it stable\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe changes under `site` and `stream/distributedlog` are used `empty commits` to trigger corresponding

ExplicitLac in db ledger storage\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nDbLedgerStorage was developed in yahoo and just merged recently to master. This implementation only works for v2 protocol.\nIt doesn't work with v3 protocol. When using v3 protocol clients (e.g. dlog library) to talk to bookies use DbLedgerStorage,\nthe clients hang on waiting responses. because a few methods in DbLedgerStorage throw UnsupportedException\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis change focuses on adding the implementations for those methods, in order to support LacPiggyback, LongPoll and ExplicitLac\nfor v3 protocol. The implementation follows what we had in FileInfoCache but did it in a much simpler way, since all the persistence\ninformation has been managed by db ledger storage itself. All the information required by `LacPiggyback`, `LongPoll` and `ExplicitLac`\nare transient.\n\nThis change doesn't introduce any new test cases. It reuses existing test cases to test those features using DbLedgerStorage. These\ntests are:\n\n- ExplicitLacTest: for testing explicit lac\n- TestPiggybackLAC: for testing piggback lac\n- TestReadLastConfirmedLongPoll: for testing long polling lac\n-

callbacks in MavenClassLoader\n\nTo properly test some functionality we need to be able to call static\nmethods (e.g. for the creation of ByteBuf), and also to be able to\nbuild callbacks (e.g. to call async methods).\n\nThis patch implements methods for doing this. For static methods, you\nneed to pass the className, the method name and a list of\narguments. It first tries to find the method using non-primitive\ntypes, but falls back to trying primative types if possible.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ncl.callStaticMethod(\"org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException\",\n                    \"create\", [-101])\n```\n\nFor callbacks you specify an interface and the a groovy closure.\nIt is assumed the closure will take as many arguments as the\ncallback. The invokation handler doesn't check the method name\ncalled on the callback object, so it only works with callbacks\nwith a single method.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ndef callback = classLoader.createCallback(\n    \"org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback\\$AddCallback\",\n        { rc, _ledger, entryId, ctx ->\n            // do something\n        })\n```\n\nAuthor: Ivan

CompositeByteBuf because of perf regression with Netty > 4.1.12\n\nStarting from Netty-4.1.13 some internal behavior has changed and that has introduced a performance penalty when using the `DoubleByteBuf`.\n\nThe problem resides in the fact that netty falls back to calling `nioBuffers()` and that is creating an array of unpooled direct `ByteBuffers`. That is pretty heavy and the JVM is taking 1 to 3 seconds GC pause to reclaim them.\n\nShort term fix is to go back to `CompositeByteBuf` which doesn't have the problem (the `DirectByteBuffer` instances are pooled and reused). I have verified that GC is back to normal after this patch.\n\nMore mid-term, since `CompositeByteBuf` allocates a bunch of objects (counted ~10 per entry) I have a change to replace it with a `ByteBufList` holder class. I have the change almost done but it will take a while to test it to verify corner cases.\n\nThis should be considered for a 4.6.2 fix release.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli
