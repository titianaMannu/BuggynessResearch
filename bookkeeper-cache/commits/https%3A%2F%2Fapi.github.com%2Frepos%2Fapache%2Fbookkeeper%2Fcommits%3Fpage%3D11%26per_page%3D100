write cache flush in DbLedgerStorage\n\n`DbLedgerStorage` uses an in-memory write cache to accumulate entries before writing into the entry log.\n\nThe flush of the write cache is triggered by 2 factors:\n 1. `SyncThread` issuing a checkpoint (eg: every 10sec or 1min)\n 2. Write cache is full, so we need to force the flush\n\nIn case (1), the checkpoint is also communicated to the journal which can then move the `logMark` forward and eventually discard old unused journals.\n\nIn cae (2), we're not moving the `logMark`. This has few side effects:\n 1. When restarting the bookie it will replay a bigger portion of the journal\n 2. We are moving the `logMark` only every 1min, so we need to keep 1minute of journals on disk\n    - If the disk hosting the journal(s) has low capacity, it can fill it up\n    - This is evident when mounting the journal on a 60GB ram-disk and using 8 journals in the bookie. At a sufficient rate, the write cache keeps getting flushed, but the journals are only trimmed after 1 minute, thus accumulating 1min worth of writes in the journal device, filling up the space.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1261 from

just make sure the 'new ledger' journal entry is added after an entry is added to ledger storage. so it make sure when checkpoint happen it will flush and create the ledger before moving the journal mark.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Charan Reddy Guttapalem <reddycharan18@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>, Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1256 from sijie/fix_db_ledger_storage_checkpoint, closes #1255","tree":{"sha":"ca6e873f5e36d1936c3d1a629815b87941cd93c4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/ca6e873f5e36d1936c3d1a629815b87941cd93c4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7e8980fff096a9111e9365d0dc959af0625a87db/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294"}]},{"sha":"96ff1c0d44bf1ac6b0ce3ca21053ae10ab7e2294","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5NmZmMWMwZDQ0YmYxYWM2YjBjZTNjYTIxMDUzYWUxMGFiN2UyMjk0","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-03-14T14:20:03Z"},"committer":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-03-14T14:20:03Z"},"message":"Jenkins seed job for testing DSLs\n\nThe job allows you to specify a repo and a branch.

ExplicitLac in db ledger storage\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nDbLedgerStorage was developed in yahoo and just merged recently to master. This implementation only works for v2 protocol.\nIt doesn't work with v3 protocol. When using v3 protocol clients (e.g. dlog library) to talk to bookies use DbLedgerStorage,\nthe clients hang on waiting responses. because a few methods in DbLedgerStorage throw UnsupportedException\n\n*Solution*\n\nThis change focuses on adding the implementations for those methods, in order to support LacPiggyback, LongPoll and ExplicitLac\nfor v3 protocol. The implementation follows what we had in FileInfoCache but did it in a much simpler way, since all the persistence\ninformation has been managed by db ledger storage itself. All the information required by `LacPiggyback`, `LongPoll` and `ExplicitLac`\nare transient.\n\nThis change doesn't introduce any new test cases. It reuses existing test cases to test those features using DbLedgerStorage. These\ntests are:\n\n- ExplicitLacTest: for testing explicit lac\n- TestPiggybackLAC: for testing piggback lac\n- TestReadLastConfirmedLongPoll: for testing long polling lac\n- TestReadLastConfirmedAndEntry: for testing entry piggyback\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1218

recovery reads/writes\n\nThe change adds a new flag for reads, RECOVERY_READ. This flag is set\nwhen a client is retrying to recover a ledger. Recovery reads should\nbe higher priority than normal reads, as recovery usually happens when\na writer has failed, and another node needs to take over the stream\nthat that ledger belonged to. All writes on that stream are blocked\nuntil the ledger the ledger has been recovered, so giving these reads\npriority will mean the stream is out for action for the shortest\namount of time possible.\n\nPriority is given to these reads by executing the reads directly in\nthe BookieRequestProcessor, rather than adding them to the\nreadThreadPool where they could end up queuing.\n\nThis change was originally 372a99db in the yahoo.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <None>\n\nThis closes #898 from ivankelly/yahoo-bp-10","tree":{"sha":"7e4b8eee489030194e47fe271627e60f1977e44b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/7e4b8eee489030194e47fe271627e60f1977e44b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7540adf110671dc4cea94b5b79b2d379f068d41b/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3"}]},{"sha":"538aee9e8bb5ef72fa780f76dba2b32701c947b3","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo1MzhhZWU5ZThiYjVlZjcyZmE3ODBmNzZkYmEyYjMyNzAxYzk0N2Iz","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-28T02:09:55Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-28T02:09:55Z"},"message":"Use the bk OrderedScheduler in dlog\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nDlog has an implementation of OrderedScheduler inspired of bk `OrderedScheduler`.
