Specifically, the\nstarter latch would be counted down, so the main thread would start to\nclose, then the shutdown hook would run, try to close, and get an\nexception when it tried to change the state. Once the all shutdown\nhooks end, the process exits, even if main hasn't completed. This\nleaves the zookeeper session open.\n\nI've removed the close from main(). The shutdown hook always runs\non a graceful shutdown, so that's the place to do the cleanup.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1132 from ivankelly/shut-race","tree":{"sha":"eb3ca6ef624ed7f67a62c569c96058151bb43556","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/eb3ca6ef624ed7f67a62c569c96058151bb43556"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/89eca5ce717a04c6e3ffa2b0aca615f4e38eafe3","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/89eca5ce717a04c6e3ffa2b0aca615f4e38eafe3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/89eca5ce717a04c6e3ffa2b0aca615f4e38eafe3","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/89eca5ce717a04c6e3ffa2b0aca615f4e38eafe3/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"21a89a7c486b842846ba9c15d6ec52d4486dd74c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/21a89a7c486b842846ba9c15d6ec52d4486dd74c","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/21a89a7c486b842846ba9c15d6ec52d4486dd74c"}]},{"sha":"21a89a7c486b842846ba9c15d6ec52d4486dd74c","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjoyMWE4OWE3YzQ4NmI4NDI4NDZiYTljMTVkNmVjNTJkNDQ4NmRkNzRj","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-02-13T16:50:36Z"},"committer":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2018-02-13T16:50:36Z"},"message":"Require green CI before merge\n\nCI has been broken since the 2018-02-06, due to a non-green patch\nbeing merged.

interface\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis change is mainly to remove `zookeeper` reference from metadata interface. The existence of `Optional<ZooKeeper>` is to allow passing an external zookeeper client to bookkeeper, so bookkeeper can reuse that client instance. That is useful for services like pulsar broker, which they can only instantiate a zookeeper client and pass the zookeeper client around to construct bookkeeper client. However, this pollutes the registration client interface, change the method to `Optional<Object>` as an optional context object and let the implementation interpret it.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo

recovery, return NoSuchEntry on wQ-aQ+1 errors\n\nIn the case of a recovery read, we rely on a NoSuchEntry response on the\nfirst missing entry to determine the final LAC.  As such, we need to\nconsider an entry to be gone once we see wQ-aQ+1 NoSuchEntry/Ledger\nresponses from bookies.  Otherwise, a zombie bookie can prevent ledger\nrecovery from suceeding indefinitely (it'll hit the timeout each time).\n\nThere was some preexisting logic from\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-365\nb6c1a8bbd7c2d44c2edb59d9938fa073f6f478de,\nbut it seems to have been too conservative in that it waited for all\nresponses and required that there were no other errors present.  It\nseems now to be unnecessary, and so has been removed.\n\nTestParallelRead.testFailParallelReadMissingEntryImmediately seemed to\nrely on the previous logic working outside of recovery, but I believe it\nwas really meant to test the recovery case, so it has been adjusted.\n\n(bug W-4651456)\nSigned-off-by: Samuel Just <sjustsalesforce.com>\n\nAuthor: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>, Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <None>\n\nThis closes #1077 from athanatos/forupstream/wip-4651456-recovery-read, closes #1067","tree":{"sha":"5687ae138d570f4c8a570bfb07c2fab1079a0a4d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/5687ae138d570f4c8a570bfb07c2fab1079a0a4d"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c"}]},{"sha":"9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5ZDA5YTljMmE2NGI3NDUyNzFlZjFjNmRhZDllNWFiM2FiM2YyYTVj","commit":{"author":{"name":"JV Jujjuri","email":"vjujjuri@vjujjuri-ltm2.internal.salesforce.com","date":"2018-02-03T00:22:56Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-03T00:22:56Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1063: Write keeps refCnt longer\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nCurrent code keeps the toSend buffers until client receives\nresonses from all wq bookies.

However, this class is getting bigger with more commands added to it. It is facing a few problems for maintenance and extensibility.\n\n- All commands sit in one gaint shell class. It is hard to tell if a command is used for managing a bookie only or if a command is used for managing a cluster.\n- Lack of unit tests. This class has very few test coverage. Most of the commands (introduced in early days) don't have a unit test.\n- Lack of extensibility. If a new function component (for example, dlog) is introduced, it is a bit hard to extend this CLI to have commands for new function component.\n\nAll these problems lead to the proposal here. This proposal is to propose refactoring/redesigning the bookkeeper CLI to allow better managebility for maintenance, better test coverage and better extensibility for new function components.\n\nMaster Issue: #1000\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1093 from sijie/BP_27_new_bookkeeper_cli","tree":{"sha":"33c3c1b7dfef1777b3bdd2fb57e0878bb318dd95","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/33c3c1b7dfef1777b3bdd2fb57e0878bb318dd95"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/49b011b3ba4d71482bb50be72f69b505c697aad4","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/49b011b3ba4d71482bb50be72f69b505c697aad4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/49b011b3ba4d71482bb50be72f69b505c697aad4","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/49b011b3ba4d71482bb50be72f69b505c697aad4/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"f83efd4fe6a4a32ffbccb49d1905d50e8013f15b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/f83efd4fe6a4a32ffbccb49d1905d50e8013f15b","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/f83efd4fe6a4a32ffbccb49d1905d50e8013f15b"}]},{"sha":"f83efd4fe6a4a32ffbccb49d1905d50e8013f15b","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjpmODNlZmQ0ZmU2YTRhMzJmZmJjY2I0OWQxOTA1ZDUwZTgwMTNmMTVi","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-02T04:11:30Z"},"committer":{"name":"Jia Zhai","email":"zhaijia@apache.org","date":"2018-02-02T04:11:30Z"},"message":"Run checkstyle plugin at validate phase\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nMost of the modules run checkstyle plugin at validate phase.
