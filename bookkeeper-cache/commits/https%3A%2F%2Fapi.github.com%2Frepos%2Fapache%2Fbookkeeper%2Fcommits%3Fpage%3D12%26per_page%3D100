callbacks in MavenClassLoader\n\nTo properly test some functionality we need to be able to call static\nmethods (e.g. for the creation of ByteBuf), and also to be able to\nbuild callbacks (e.g. to call async methods).\n\nThis patch implements methods for doing this. For static methods, you\nneed to pass the className, the method name and a list of\narguments. It first tries to find the method using non-primitive\ntypes, but falls back to trying primative types if possible.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ncl.callStaticMethod(\"org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException\",\n                    \"create\", [-101])\n```\n\nFor callbacks you specify an interface and the a groovy closure.\nIt is assumed the closure will take as many arguments as the\ncallback. The invokation handler doesn't check the method name\ncalled on the callback object, so it only works with callbacks\nwith a single method.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ndef callback =

CompositeByteBuf because of perf regression with Netty > 4.1.12\n\nStarting from Netty-4.1.13 some internal behavior has changed and that has introduced a performance penalty when using the `DoubleByteBuf`.\n\nThe problem resides in the fact that netty falls back to calling `nioBuffers()` and that is creating an array of unpooled direct `ByteBuffers`. That is pretty heavy and the JVM is taking 1 to 3 seconds GC pause to reclaim them.\n\nShort term fix is to go back to `CompositeByteBuf` which doesn't have the problem (the `DirectByteBuffer` instances are pooled and reused). I have verified that GC is back to normal after this patch.\n\nMore mid-term, since `CompositeByteBuf` allocates a bunch of objects (counted ~10 per entry) I have a change to replace it with a `ByteBufList` holder class. I have the change almost done but it will take a while to test it to verify corner cases.\n\nThis should be considered for a 4.6.2 fix release.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli

interface\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis change is mainly to remove `zookeeper` reference from metadata interface. The existence of `Optional<ZooKeeper>` is to allow passing an external zookeeper client to bookkeeper, so bookkeeper can reuse that client instance. That is useful for services like pulsar broker, which they can only instantiate a zookeeper client and pass the zookeeper client around to construct bookkeeper client. However, this pollutes the registration client interface, change the method to `Optional<Object>` as an optional context object and let the implementation interpret it.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo

recovery, return NoSuchEntry on wQ-aQ+1 errors\n\nIn the case of a recovery read, we rely on a NoSuchEntry response on the\nfirst missing entry to determine the final LAC.

Otherwise, a zombie bookie can prevent ledger\nrecovery from suceeding indefinitely (it'll hit the timeout each time).\n\nThere was some preexisting logic from\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-365\nb6c1a8bbd7c2d44c2edb59d9938fa073f6f478de,\nbut it seems to have been too conservative in that it waited for all\nresponses and required that there were no other errors present.  It\nseems now to be unnecessary, and so has been removed.\n\nTestParallelRead.testFailParallelReadMissingEntryImmediately seemed to\nrely on the previous logic working outside of recovery, but I believe it\nwas really meant to test the recovery case, so it has been adjusted.\n\n(bug W-4651456)\nSigned-off-by: Samuel Just <sjustsalesforce.com>\n\nAuthor: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Samuel Just <sjust@salesforce.com>, Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <None>\n\nThis closes #1077 from athanatos/forupstream/wip-4651456-recovery-read, closes #1067","tree":{"sha":"5687ae138d570f4c8a570bfb07c2fab1079a0a4d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/5687ae138d570f4c8a570bfb07c2fab1079a0a4d"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/e6a2a13876fe676b8fcafa56c3568ea450ad5f67/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c"}]},{"sha":"9d09a9c2a64b745271ef1c6dad9e5ab3ab3f2a5c","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5ZDA5YTljMmE2NGI3NDUyNzFlZjFjNmRhZDllNWFiM2FiM2YyYTVj","commit":{"author":{"name":"JV Jujjuri","email":"vjujjuri@vjujjuri-ltm2.internal.salesforce.com","date":"2018-02-03T00:22:56Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-02-03T00:22:56Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1063: Write keeps refCnt longer\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nCurrent code keeps the toSend buffers until client receives\nresonses from all wq bookies.

However, this class is getting bigger with more commands added to it. It is facing a few problems for maintenance and extensibility.\n\n- All commands sit in one gaint shell class. It is hard to tell if a command is used for managing a bookie only or if a command is used for managing a cluster.\n- Lack of unit tests. This class has very few test coverage. Most of the commands (introduced in early days) don't have a unit test.\n- Lack of extensibility. If a new function component (for example, dlog) is introduced, it is a bit hard to extend this CLI to have commands for new function component.\n\nAll these problems lead to the proposal here.
