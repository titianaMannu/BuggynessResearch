refcounting out IndexPersistenceMgr\n\nThere is a number of bugs in index persistence mgr related to how\nrefcounts are handled and how FileInfos are freed, due to the locking\nmechanism. These can result in the fencing bit being lost in ledgers,\nwhich is a serious issue. They also cause flakes in\nIndexPersistenceMgrTest#testEvictFileInfoWhenUnderlyingFileExists.\n\nFor details see the discussion at:\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/513/files/8075b0#r156676238\n\nThere are two key problems.\n\n1. FileInfos are flushed asynchronously on eviction. If another thread\ntries to read the FileInfo after the flush has been scheduled, but\nbefore it runs, it will read stale date (and we'll possibly lose the\nfence bit).\n2. FileInfos can be closed while it is still references in the\nIndexPersistenceMgr. This means that it can be fenced, but this will\nvery be flushed to disk because the FileInfo is already closed.\n\nThe patch solves this by moving FileInfo locking and refcount into a\nseparate class, FileInfoBackingCache. When either the write cache or\nread cache load a file info, it tries to load it from this backing\ncache. All writes to the the backing cache are done under a write\nlock. This class also takes care of reference counting. It hands out\nCachedFileInfo objects, which will be flushed to disk when all\nreferences are released.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Sijie
