bookkeeper-server jar\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n**Problem:**\n\n`shadedArtifactAttached` was introduced in 4.6.0 to generate plain and shaded artifact for `bookkeeper-server`. Because for projects (e.g. distributedlog) that would use same protobuf and guava version as bookkeeper, they will use the plain artifact (to avoid shading protobuf/guava multiple times). However there are a few problems with that:\n\n1) bookkeeper-common is not included in the shading include set.\n2) `shadedArtifactAttached` only generate a shaded artifact (with relocated classes), but doesn't generate a dependency-reduced pom file. so you have to manually exclude relocated dependencies.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- for shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server`, include all the bookkeeper submodules that bookkeeper-server depends on. so the shaded artifact includes all the classes that need to be relocated.\n- introduce a `shaded` module for keeping new shaded libraries. Currently `bookkeeper-server-shaded` is a shaded module of `bookkeeper-server`, while `bookkeeper-server-tests-shaded` is a shaded moulde of the tests jar of `bookkeeper-server`.\n- update the client api documentation about the instructions on how to use shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server` and the new shaded module `bookkeeper-server-shaded`.\n- add test cases to verify the shaded artifact and the new shaded modules generate the right artifacts.\n\n**This change doesn't address:**\n\nCurrently both client and server are bundled in one `bookkeeper-server`. this change will not introduce any shaded client-only jar. that would be deferred until we split `bookkeeper-server` module.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #928 from sijie/fix_shading, closes #922","tree":{"sha":"635cef47ce593702df4ed5ed36641ab3f79e7676","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/635cef47ce593702df4ed5ed36641ab3f79e7676"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1ed78912907cd2157f0b93ecaa653923ede4365c/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6"}]},{"sha":"1f8b26d5f02ae6bccf0d586bcb145f4461f4fde6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjoxZjhiMjZkNWYwMmFlNmJjY2YwZDU4NmJjYjE0NWY0NDYxZjRmZGU2","commit":{"author":{"name":"Samuel Just","email":"sjust@salesforce.com","date":"2017-12-27T06:48:00Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2017-12-27T06:48:00Z"},"message":"ISSUE #870: ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector: harden against LM bugs\n\nThe idea behind this patch is to make it more likely that more than one\nLedgerManager bug would be required to erroneously believe a ledger to be\ndeleted.\n1) Remove the special handling for the completely empty LM.  It's not\nreally a common case nor is it much of an optimization even when it\nhappens.\n2) Add a config variable to cause the bookie to also check the\nLedgerManager.readLedgerMetadata path before actually removing a ledger.\nThe implementations of readLedgerMetadata and the iterator are\nsufficiently different that it seems worth it to have the option of\nchecking both to guard somewhat

LongHierarchicalLedgerManager: refactor to fix races\n\nLongHierarchicalLedgerRangeIterator.initialize() could erroneously exit\nwith iteratorDone if the lexicographically first path in zk had fewer\nthan 4 levels.  This can happen for a few reasons including a case where\na client creating a ledger on that path crashed during the zk updates or\nthe iterator.hasNext() call simply raced with an in-progress node\ncreation or removal.  ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector is hasNext()\nreturns false will delete all ledgers on the bookie, so this is a fairly\nserious bug.\n\nRuling out other such bugs was fairly dificult with the structure

force to re-insert the master key in ledger storage\n\nWhen the bookie crashes and restart, it will replay the entries from the journal. In the case of ledgers that were created, but their metadata was not flushed on disk, the ledger metadata might be lost.\n\nThis is more evident in `DbLedgerStorage`, since the ledger metadata is cached in memory and it's only inserted in the db at the checkpoint time, though it applies as well for `InterleavedLedgerStorage` where the ledger metadata was inserted in the cache but not fsynced on disk.\n\nIf the page cache content is gone, when replaying the journal content, the ledger will be tracked in memory but the bookie won't have the metadata on disk anymore.\n\nMerging from yahoo

ReadCache\n\nAdds a `ReadCache` class to be used from LedgerStorage.\n\nThe read cache is used when doing read-ahead caching after reading one entry.\n\nThe idea is that entries for the same ledger as stored in order (for each flush cycle, eg: 1min). When reading 1 entry, we expect the client to read all subsequent entries. We can then skip the RocksDb `get()` to fetch the index of the entries, by just keep reading from the entryLog, and exploiting page cache and seqeuential reads. The entries are then added to this ReadCache, where they will looked when the request for next entry comes in.\n\nThis implementation is based on dividing the memory into multiple segments. Whenever the read cache is full, the oldest segment gets recycled and overwritten with new entries.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis

batch rather than individually\n\nThis patch is a squash of f59b597f, 00fc5cd2, 1658eb61 & 833dc307 from the yahoo-4.3 branch. The change removes the HashWheelTimer from PerChannelBookieClient and instead runs through all outstanding ops periodically, timing them out as necessary.\n\nThe motivation for this change is to reduce the number of objects created per add/read request. With HashWheelTimer a TimerTask needs to be added to the Timer, which allocates and returns a Timeout object. We had to be careful to cancel this timeout on success.\n\nThe new approach is simpler, doesn't require any allocation per request, and doesn't require any cancellation. Functionally the end result is the same - very slow requests are timed out.\n\nThe patch also makes some additions to the original changes (due to the codebase moving since it was originally written).\n- PendingAddOps are changed to use the same mechanism for quorum timeouts.\n- The checkTimeout method is moved to the PCBCPool so we can run the check on non-connected PCBC instances. This is necessary for TLS.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\nAuthor: Siddharth Boobna <sboobna@yahoo-inc.com>\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli

channel inactive before callback\n\nThere's a race in PCBC where if the channel is errored before the\nconnection callback occurs, the channel will hang around as a zombie\nforever.\n\nThis caused a flake in\nTestDisableEnsembleChange#testRetryFailureBookie, but the problem\nitself could affect production code. This test hit it because it tries\nto reconnect in a tight loop as a bookie is booting.\n\nThe error occurs because we only change state with channelInactive if\nthe channelInactive occurred on the channel that matches the currently\nassigned this.channel. If the channel connects successfully, but\nchannelInactive occurs before the connect callback runs, the channel\nwill be closed, but the state will be transitioned to CONNECTED. No\nmore events will occur on the channel, so it'll hang around forever,\nand all requests on the channel will timeout.\n\nThe fix is to check that the channel is active before assigning it to\nthis.channel and setting state to CONNECTED. If the channel is not\nactive at this point, then the else clause of this block will run\nwhich closes the channel, and sets state to DISCONNECTED. In this\ncase, the next request will trigger a new connection attempt.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #827 from

The `Long` used for key and value are 16 bytes each and the hash-map node will take another ~24 bytes.\n\nAdditionally, all these objects are created, stored for hours and then GCed, after being tenured.\n\nBy using `ConcurrentLongLongHashMap`, we eliminate the object boxing and the need for the \"node\" since it's a open hashmap. This helps reducing a lot the memory used by the bookie when storing a large amount of entries (54 --> 16 bytes).\nAlso since we store the items in `long[]`, this will not need objects and it will not
