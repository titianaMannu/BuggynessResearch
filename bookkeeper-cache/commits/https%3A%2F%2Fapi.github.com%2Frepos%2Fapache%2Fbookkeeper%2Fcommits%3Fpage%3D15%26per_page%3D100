on bookie and client\n\nPart of #230, this adds checkstyle verification to the bookie and client packages in `bookkeeper-server`.\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThe changes here are primarily cosmetic, but there are also two notable changes to point out:\n\n1. In both `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.TruePredicate` and `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.EnsembleForReplacementWithNoConstraints` a `public static final` field was renamed from `instance` to `INSTANCE`. This is consistent with the use of an `INSTANCE` field in the `bookkeeper-stats` package. An alternative would be to introduce a public method `getInstance()`, but either way the checkstyle rules don't like a public constant field in lower case.\n\n2. In `UpdateLedgerOp#updateBookieIdInLedgers()`, the `throws BKException` part of the signature is problematic and prevents the checkstyle validation from completing successfully. From what I can tell, that checked exception is never thrown; as such, I have removed that from the signature. I have also removed the corresponding guard from `bookie.BookieShell`.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Coburn <acoburn@amherst.edu>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo

Checkstyle on the proto package\n\nThis is part of #230 and adds Checkstyle verification to the proto\npackage in bookeeper-server.\n\nThe changes here should generally be non-controversial, but I would like to highlight one change for particular review. In the `PerChannelBookieClient` class, there is a `public static final` field called `txnIdGenerator`. The checkstyle rules require that such public fields are ALL_CAPS. So one option would be to change that field to `TX_ID_GENERATOR` (this would be a change to the public API).\n\nThe relevant diff is here: https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/compare/master...acoburn:checkstyle_proto?expand=1#diff-e50ee2c1aec1539ea185a94605b0e550R143\n\nHowever, that field is never used outside this class, so the other option is to make the field private and keep the name as-is. (Making the field private is also a change to the public API)\n\nI chose the second option because the field seemed more like an internal field. If, however, the field should be left public, I can add a commit that changes the name to `TX_ID_GENERATOR` so that it passes the checkstyle rules.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Coburn

Checkstyle on the conf package\n\nThis is part of #230 and adds Checkstyle verification to the conf\npackage in bookkeeper-server.\n\nAs with #792, most of the changes here should be non-controversial. However, as with #792, there is a constant field whose name needed to be renamed. `AbstractConfiguration` has a `protected static final` field called `defaultLoader`. This field is used in the two implementing classes, so keeping `protected` visibility seems right. So in this case, the field has been renamed to `DEFAULT_LOADER` while keeping the `protected static final` modifiers.\n\nThe changed line is:

started bookie\n\nUp until now we were only waiting for the bookie to exist in the\nbookie list, after which we triggered a read.

read request indefinitely\n\nIntegrating some changes made to Yahoo bookkeeper by Matteo Merli.\n\nThe apache bookkeeper thread pool in use by OrderedScheduler is different, and does not have access to setting a queue size limit, so I created QueueAssessibleExecutorService, and check the queue size instead.  Other than that, this code change is pretty similar to Yahoo's.\n\nOriginal bug description for this change:\n\nSince we are using a thread pool to handle read requests in bookies, we have seen that when the Bookie read IO is maxed out, the requests are being accumulated in the bookie.\n\nEssentially, the bookie is busy serving read requests that have already been timed out on the client side (end to end read latency can reach hours..). The queue keeps growing indefinitely, leading to OOM errors and bookie restart.\n\nAll unit tests pass for me locally with this change.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Gresch <agresch@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers:

for compaction and add transaction support\n\nProblem:\nCompaction might keep generating duplicated data which would cause disk full.\nThis is because we don't have transactional operation for compaction. So if compaction\nkeeps failing in the middle, bookie would end up with a lot of garbage data.\n\nChange:\n1. Introduce abstract class AbstractLogCompactor with an interface compact().\n2. Move the existing compaction logic to a separate class called EntryLogCompactor.\n3. Introduce transactional compaction, we can recover an incomplete compaction or rollback a compaction failure.\n4. Add an configuration to enable transactional compaction\n\nPotential Risk:\n1. No risk if we keep using the default compactor.\n2. If we choose to enable transactional compaction with separate log file, we need to be careful about it, since we use a separate log for compaction, if we have a lot of old small ledgers in the bookie, we will end up with a lot of small entry log files. And this will potentially cause bookkeeper \"Too many open files\" because GC will scan all the entry log files and keep them open.\n\nAuthor: Yiming Zang <yzang@twitter.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico

pick a bookie from the available bookies in the cluster to satisfy the placement constraint. (#596)\n2. hence, remove `targetBookie` from ReplicationWorker, because the parameter will volatile the placement constraint. (#583)\n3. at the same time, change `LedgerFragement` to represent the number of bookies that need to be check and replicate. a) the ledger checker can use the correct bookie index for verifying the existence of entries in a bookie (for stripping case) b) only read entries one time when need to replicate them to multiple bookies.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly
