BookieInfoReader and fix associated test flappers\n\nBookieInfoReader:\n\nThe previous syncronization logic wasn't really correct, and the logic\nat the top of the method was far more complicated than it needed to be.\nRestrict bookies to be non-null.  Restructure the code to simply use\nthe BookieInfoReader instance as a single lock.\n\nOne significant behavioral change is that we scan every bookie not in\nthe map, and we clear from the map bookies which returned an error.\n\nAlso, explicitely cache the most recent bookie set reported by the\nBookieWatcher.  This eliminates the need to call into BookieWatcher\nfrom getReadWriteBookieInfo and the corresponding error path.  The\nperiodic scan continues to explicitely check.\n\nAnother departure is the addition of an explicit retry-on-error param to\ntrigger retry if any of the requests failed\n(getBookieInfoRetryIntervalSeconds).  We'll only retry the ones that\nactually failed (along with any new additions since the last run).  This\nis useful because bookie startup triggers the addition of the bookie\nnode to zk before the bookie actually becomes available for the bookie\ninfo request, so there can be rare races in the unit tests between\nBookieInfoReader requesting the info and the bookie actually being up.\n\nAlso, add a method to allow tests to wait for updates to be reflected.\n\nPerChannelBookieClient: fix error handling for BookieInfo keys\n\nPassing a key corresponding to a GET_BOOKIE_INFO operation to\nerrorOutReadKey results in a casting exception, clean up the invalid\ncalls.\n\nBookKeeperClusterTestCase: add killBookieAndWaitForZK\n\nShould reduce the need for tests to wait for an arbitrary period to let\nthe cluster \"settle\".\n\nBookKeeperDiskSpaceWeightedLedgerPlacementTest:\n\nThis test was heavily time dependent, and the Thread.sleep values did\nnot work universally.  Instead, eliminate the arbitrary Thread.sleep\nvalues and instead verify the free space changes on each change.\n\nAlso, switch the delay

logic\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nProblem:\n    When bookie receive a fence request and couldn't find any writable dirs for the new index file, it will throw exception. This behavior can be improved, because as long as ledger fence request be persisted in Journal, we can say the fence request succeed. It should not depends on the success of flushing new index file.\n\nSolution:\n\n- Add option to fall back to pick from all directories regardless of writable or not when we getFileInfo for a new

TestBackwardCompat.testCompat410 often fails due to io.netty.util.IllegalReferenceCountException\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nProblem:\n\nin TestBackwardCompat#testCompact400, the test is to verify the current client can't talk to a 4.0.0 server.\n\nThe 4.5.0 client is sending a protobuf encoded request to 4.0.0 server. The 4.0.0 server will interpret the 4.5.0 protobuf encoded request, but it will realize this is bad request and sending v2 protocol encoded response. because the request is a bad request, 4.0.0 server sent a response back with unknown op code.\n\nIn current v2 ResponseEnDecoder (listed as below), when it doesn't know the op code, it will return the buffer to the channel. this might cause the misbehavior in the channel pipeline to decrement reference count.\n\nSolution:\n\nthrow exception in the EnDeCoder when receiving unknown op code. so the netty can close the connection, error out the pending requests and cleaning up the resources.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Matteo Merli <None>\n\nThis closes #219 from sijie/issue_198, closes #198","tree":{"sha":"67ae0fb04cb2f2bbd8c1c1e9653d1f2db7f85e15","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/67ae0fb04cb2f2bbd8c1c1e9653d1f2db7f85e15"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1b0492bf2ac547cf583736d3eaf9849498e42f80/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147"}]},{"sha":"5e399df67c2aa1e5f228c62ba8533ca3293ab147","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo1ZTM5OWRmNjdjMmFhMWU1ZjIyOGM2MmJhODUzM2NhMzI5M2FiMTQ3","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijieg@twitter.com","date":"2017-06-29T22:12:40Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2017-06-29T22:12:40Z"},"message":"BOOKKEEPER-759: Delay Ensemble Change & Disable Ensemble Change\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis pull request contains the changes around ensemble change.\n\n- Delay Ensemble Change: Provide a flag to allow delay ensemble change. if that is set to change, will not do ensemble change until it breaks ack quorum requirements.\n- Disable Ensemble Change: Provide a runtime feature flag to allow disabling ensemble change.
