Sep 23 05:57:30 2015 -0700\n\nBK LedgerMetadata: more memory-efficient parsing of configs\nLooking at the most prevalent client-side memory allocations, I noticed that we allocate 4KB every time we open a ledger. This is caused by allocating a 4KB buffer (in TextFormat.toStringBuilder) to account for the maximum possible Protobufs message, which is unnecessary in our case: we know the exact size of the metadata ( << 500 B) and don't need to allocate more.\nTextFormat.merge(Readable, Message.Builder) is the current method we use. This changes to use TextFormat.merge(CharSequence, Message.Builder), which avoids the extra 4K allocation conversion + an extra StringBuilder.\n\nRB_ID=745700\n\nAuthor: Alex Yarmula

ByteBuf in LedgerEntry to avoid data copy\n\nTo avoid copying the entries payloads when writing/reading on a ledger and having to allocate a lot of `byte[]` on the JVM heap, we need to accept Netty ByteBuf buffer.\n\nBy passing a ByteBuf, an application can use a pooled buffer, pointing to direct memory, to the `LedgerHandle.addEntry()` and have the same buffer forwarded on the connection sockets to the bookies.\n\nThe same thing on the read side, `LedgerEntry` exposes an additional `getEntryBuffer()` method that can be used to get the underlying buffer and possibly forward that to some other connection, with zero-copy behavior (excluding getting data in-out of the kernel).\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai, Sijie Guo, Enrico

LedgerHandle creates a timer thread to send explicit LACs\nat the intervals specified through configuration paramenter,\nexplicitLacInterval. If this is set to zero, this feature is disabled,\nno timer thread is created.\n\nExplicit LAC is sent only if the client did not get a chance to send\nLAC through piggyback method for \"explicitLacInterval\" time.\nTo implement this, introduced two new protocol messages to the\nBookkeeper protocol -  WRITE_LAC and READ_LAC, in addition to its\ncurrent READ_ENTRY and ADD_ENTRY.\n\nReviewed-by: Charan Reddy Guttapalem <cguttapalemsalesforce.com>\nSigned-off-by: Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <vjujjurisalesforce.com>\nCo-Author : Charan Reddy Guttapalem
