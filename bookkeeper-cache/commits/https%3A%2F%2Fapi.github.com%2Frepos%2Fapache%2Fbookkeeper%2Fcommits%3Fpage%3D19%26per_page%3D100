store\n\nThis change is to abstract the zookeeper operations into a stream metadata store, so we can replace zookeeper with other metadata store easily.\n\nSo the metadata operations in distributedlog now are managed by 3 classes:\n\n- LogMetadataStore : it is the namespace metadata store : it manages the location (uri) mapping for streams and handle namespace operations.\n- LogStreamMetadataStore: it is the stream metadata store : it manages the metadata for a single stream, such as managing read/write lock, retriving/creating stream metadata, deleting metadata and such.\n- LogSegmentMetadataStore: it is the segment metadata store : it manages the log segment metadata for individual log segment.\n\nLogMetadataStore and LogSegmentMetadataStore are already there. This change focus on LogStreamMetadataStore\n\nChanged:\n\n* abstract all the zookeeper metadata operation in log handlers to LogStreamMetadataStore\n* remove disabling max tx id santify check, as maxTxId update is part of the metadata update transaction\n\nNot changed:\n\nthe name of ZKLogMetadataForReader and ZKLogMetadataForWriter are not changed. I will send out a change to rename these two classes as they are not related to zookeeper anymore.","tree":{"sha":"71efddc72d1edb15012af9f92a34b9e0394b0dff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/71efddc72d1edb15012af9f92a34b9e0394b0dff"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/de4711ddf87571c4de5686385663aef3f19fcaf7","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/de4711ddf87571c4de5686385663aef3f19fcaf7","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/de4711ddf87571c4de5686385663aef3f19fcaf7","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/de4711ddf87571c4de5686385663aef3f19fcaf7/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"68f796019ce771a44ba20548046a444177143be0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/68f796019ce771a44ba20548046a444177143be0","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/68f796019ce771a44ba20548046a444177143be0"}]},{"sha":"68f796019ce771a44ba20548046a444177143be0","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo2OGY3OTYwMTljZTc3MWE0NGJhMjA1NDgwNDZhNDQ0MTc3MTQzYmUw","commit":{"author":{"name":"Yiming

maps and sets for primitive types\n\nIn BookKeeper there are many instances of maps and sets that use ledger id\nand entry ids as keys or values. JDK concurrent collections have the overhead\nof boxing all the primitive values into objects (eg: long --> Long) that would\nneed to be allocated from the heap. In addition to that, JDK map implementations\nare closed hash tables and they will require at least one more allocation to hold\nthe linked-list/tree node.\n\nThere are already available libraries that offer primitive collections with\nzero-allocation, but none of these support concurrent maps/sets.\n\nWe have added a handful of specializations, all based on the same implementation\nidea. We have a hash table which is broken down into multiple sections. Each\nsections, on its own, is an open hash table with linear probing, protected by\na stamped lock.\n\nAll insertions, lookups and iterations on these collections are allocation free.\n\n```\nConcurrentLongHashMap: Map<long, Object>\nConcurrentLongHashSet: Set<long>\nConcurrentLongLongHashMap: Map<long, long>\nConcurrentLongLongPairHashMap: Map< Pair<long, long>, Pair<long,

down for upgrade or even if it looses zk connection\nintermittently, the auditor detects it as a lost bookie and starts under replication detection and\nthe replication workers on other bookie nodes start replicating the under replicated ledgers. All\nof this stops once the bookie comes up but by then a few ledgers would get replicated. Given the\nfact that we have multiple copies of data, it is probably not necessary to start the recovery as\nsoon as a bookie goes down. We can wait for an hour or so and then start recovery. This should\ncover cases like planned upgrade, intermittent network connectivity loss, etc.\n\nThis change:\n    1) Provides a bookie option 'lostBookieRecoveryDelay' in secs, which when set to a non zero value,\n       will delay the start of recovery by that number of seconds. By default, this option is set to 0;\n       which means the audit is not delayed.\n    2) If another bookie were to go down in this interval, the recovery is immediately started and the\n       one scheduled for future is canceled.\n    3) Adds counters to track how many audits were delayed(#1) and how many scheduled audits were\n       canceled due to multiple bookie failures(#2).\n    4) Three junit tests to verify the new feature.\n\nAuthor: Rithin <rithin.shetty@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: siddharth.boobna@gmail.com <siddharth.boobna@gmail.com>, Enrico Olivelli
