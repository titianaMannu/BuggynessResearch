invalid ensemble issue during ledger recovery\n\nEnsures that only entries of the current ensemble are included in the ledger recovery process, thus avoiding a ledger recovery failure scenario where it tries to append an ensemble with a lower first entry id than the prior ensemble.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a small change in the LedgerRecoveryOp that avoids a scenario where ledger recovery tries to create an invalid ensemble thereby failing. This could cause data unavailability for as long as trigger conditions last.\r\n\r\nDuring ledger recovery, only entries of the current ensemble can be included in the read and write back phase. Prior ensembles, if any, are immutable. But it is possible, in a multi-ensemble ledger, for the current ensemble to return an LAC of -1. This then causes the recovery to read entries from prior ensembles and write them back to the current ensemble. This does not cause any data loss, but it is wasteful of both space and time. The main issue is that if an ensemble change occurs when writing back entries, it will try and create a new ensemble with first entry id of 0. This causes an IllegalStateException as there is a check before the CAS metadata op to ensure that the ensemble does not have an entry id lower than an existing ensemble.\r\n\r\nIf a bookie of the current ensemble were to be down, then the ledger would be unrecoverable until it became available again. \r\n\r\nThe solution is that the lowest safe LAC for recovery is: first entry id of current ensemble - 1.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nChange to LedgerRecoveryOp as described above.\r\nNew unit test in LedgerRecoveryTest2.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2615\r\n\n\nReviewers: Andrey Yegorov, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Flavio Junqueira\n\nThis closes #2654 from Vanlightly/fix-invalid-ensemble-change, closes #2615","tree":{"sha":"5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/79768fee1c28d42f4883eb80c5ab6dd88e38a4f5","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJgdIw8CRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAAdHIIAAaAksFQeB3r8TXdC/fOKxb7\nuToswFJbabcyueLNkp7W9rAHC14jQHNcJ2jLlDo9qmNBjh7CTwUclCAj9HU9LfG0\n+n6DRTlsbU7oqpzTK4Yw65Cjharrv4+OLUopoSJUv9zvN0NeY5XWsZqmTgHASIhH\n5RJcSpPeIwLFBZsAx35UcZrhQsGNXAcbs1VNZy1CldfMheBttWQywyOdFM5dyagk\nLq8H6JazG4xg7AFEpEb+Gig08f6ch2XbjA+K0AgrFWxEA9Yl/1h/LugUkuVcfAxL\nfq0N4j220QWLqVmSSfHk+dXmIo85F806nL0xniLlXAPvueO7USoxSxziGMe3zIo=\n=qPpF\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0\nparent 646e59089bc1fd881eff4cc0fb4070220d23dc86\nauthor Jack Vanlightly <vanlightly@gmail.com> 1618250812 -0700\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1618250812 -0700\n\nISSUE #2615: Fix for invalid ensemble issue during ledger recovery\n\nEnsures that only entries of the current ensemble are included in the ledger recovery process, thus avoiding a ledger recovery failure scenario where it tries to append an ensemble with a lower first entry id than the prior ensemble.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a small change in the LedgerRecoveryOp that avoids a scenario where ledger recovery tries to create an invalid ensemble thereby failing.

Unbounded execution of compaction can starve the garbage collection process, and may lead to extended periods of high disk IO. By setting a upper bound on the execution duration for the garbage collection, we can ensure a balance is maintained between both GC and Compaction processes.\r\n\r\nLogging has been improved to allow a user to see the complete usage of the buckets, vs. those that were compacted, so that they can decide on any further tuning that may be required.\r\n\r\nTest cases have been added to ensure limits are enforced properly and that defaulting of the values is correctly implemented.\r\n\r\n* 2638-CompactionLimits\r\n\r\n* align config parameters\r\n\r\n* Refactor Limit to MaxTimeMs"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/ae023fd5fab1f015229e475de106df46144bd4d0","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/ae023fd5fab1f015229e475de106df46144bd4d0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/ae023fd5fab1f015229e475de106df46144bd4d0/comments","author":{"login":"klwilson227","id":3753643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTM2NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3753643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227","html_url":"https://github.com/klwilson227","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klwilson227/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6eadbaac1806cebcf658a740b6dd7277a24e4fdb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/6eadbaac1806cebcf658a740b6dd7277a24e4fdb","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/6eadbaac1806cebcf658a740b6dd7277a24e4fdb"}]},{"sha":"6eadbaac1806cebcf658a740b6dd7277a24e4fdb","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo2ZWFkYmFhYzE4MDZjZWJjZjY1OGE3NDBiNmRkNzI3N2EyNGU0ZmRi","commit":{"author":{"name":"Surinder Singh","email":"sursingh@gmail.com","date":"2021-04-05T17:22:04Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2021-04-05T17:22:04Z"},"message":"sign published packages (#2674)\n\nAdd signing plugin to sign artifacts using PGP.

reads to avoid data loss issue\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAdding the fencing flag to recovery reads avoids a data loss scenario as described in [issue 2614](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/2614)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAdded the fencing flag to recovery reads. Refactored some mocking unit test code to introduce fencing and allow two writers to share the same bookie state. Added a new unit to verify the fix.

#2506: Skip unavailable bookies during verifyLedgerFragment\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `verifyLedgerFragment` method in the `LedgerChecker` by skipping calls to bookies that are known to be unavailable. The \"bad bookies\" are calculated by using metadata available in ZK and accessed by the `BookKeeperAdmin`. Note that `verifyLedgerFragment` will still run checks on all other bookies that appear available.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is demonstrated in #2506. As this code currently works, there are a ton of calls made to unavailable bookies with the intent of calculating bad (unavailable) bookies. This proposed change would greatly decrease the number of calls that the auditor and the replicator need to make to calculate which ledgers need replicating.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Added `getUnavailableBookies` method to the `BookKeeperAdmin`. This method could attempt to use caching, but it's not actually called that often, so I think caching might not add complexity without much value.\r\n2. Updated `verifyLedgerFragment` method signature to take a collection of `unavailableBookies`.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2506\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIf these changes are acceptable, I'd like some help identifying the best way to test these changes.
