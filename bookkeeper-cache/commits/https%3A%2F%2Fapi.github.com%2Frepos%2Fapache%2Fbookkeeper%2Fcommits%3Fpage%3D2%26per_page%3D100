invalid ensemble issue during ledger recovery\n\nEnsures that only entries of the current ensemble are included in the ledger recovery process, thus avoiding a ledger recovery failure scenario where it tries to append an ensemble with a lower first entry id than the prior ensemble.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a small change in the LedgerRecoveryOp that avoids a scenario where ledger recovery tries to create an invalid ensemble thereby failing. This could cause data unavailability for as long as trigger conditions last.\r\n\r\nDuring ledger recovery, only entries of the current ensemble can be included in the read and write back phase. Prior ensembles, if any, are immutable. But it is possible, in a multi-ensemble ledger, for the current ensemble to return an LAC of -1. This then causes the recovery to read entries from prior ensembles and write them back to the current ensemble. This does not cause any data loss, but it is wasteful of both space and time. The main issue is that if an ensemble change occurs when writing back entries, it will try and create a new ensemble with first entry id of 0. This causes an IllegalStateException as there is a check before the CAS metadata op to ensure that the ensemble does not have an entry id lower than an existing ensemble.\r\n\r\nIf a bookie of the current ensemble were to be down, then the ledger would be unrecoverable until it became available again. \r\n\r\nThe solution is that the lowest safe LAC for recovery is: first entry id of current ensemble - 1.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nChange to LedgerRecoveryOp as described above.\r\nNew unit test in LedgerRecoveryTest2.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2615\r\n\n\nReviewers: Andrey Yegorov, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Flavio Junqueira\n\nThis closes #2654 from Vanlightly/fix-invalid-ensemble-change, closes #2615","tree":{"sha":"5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/79768fee1c28d42f4883eb80c5ab6dd88e38a4f5","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":true,"reason":"valid","signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\nwsBcBAABCAAQBQJgdIw8CRBK7hj4Ov3rIwAAdHIIAAaAksFQeB3r8TXdC/fOKxb7\nuToswFJbabcyueLNkp7W9rAHC14jQHNcJ2jLlDo9qmNBjh7CTwUclCAj9HU9LfG0\n+n6DRTlsbU7oqpzTK4Yw65Cjharrv4+OLUopoSJUv9zvN0NeY5XWsZqmTgHASIhH\n5RJcSpPeIwLFBZsAx35UcZrhQsGNXAcbs1VNZy1CldfMheBttWQywyOdFM5dyagk\nLq8H6JazG4xg7AFEpEb+Gig08f6ch2XbjA+K0AgrFWxEA9Yl/1h/LugUkuVcfAxL\nfq0N4j220QWLqVmSSfHk+dXmIo85F806nL0xniLlXAPvueO7USoxSxziGMe3zIo=\n=qPpF\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n","payload":"tree 5003952196405d9c180d3e68eef34ca83f6095e0\nparent 646e59089bc1fd881eff4cc0fb4070220d23dc86\nauthor Jack Vanlightly <vanlightly@gmail.com> 1618250812 -0700\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1618250812 -0700\n\nISSUE #2615: Fix for invalid ensemble issue during ledger recovery\n\nEnsures that only entries of the current ensemble are included in the ledger recovery process, thus avoiding a ledger recovery failure scenario where it tries to append an ensemble with a lower first entry id than the prior ensemble.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a small change in the LedgerRecoveryOp that avoids a scenario where ledger recovery tries to create an invalid ensemble thereby failing.

This allows the customer to balance the needs for compaction against the need for normal garbage collection. Unbounded execution of compaction can starve the garbage collection process, and may lead to extended periods of high disk IO.

When we do a checkpoint on this new state, a new SST files\r\nare created. Since we only compare the SST file names, we assume that files is\r\nalready available in the checkpoint store.\r\n\r\nAt best the size of the new files will mismatch, and restore will fail. But if\r\nthe size of the files match, restore will succeed and we will have invalid\r\ndata in the state store.\r\n\r\nWith this change we are adding the checksum for the SST files. The checksum\r\nwill be appended to the name when the SST file is uploaded. This will ensure\r\nthat the correct files are always uploaded\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Surinder Singh

#2506: Skip unavailable bookies during verifyLedgerFragment\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `verifyLedgerFragment` method in the `LedgerChecker` by skipping calls to bookies that are known to be unavailable. The \"bad bookies\" are calculated by using metadata available in ZK and accessed by the `BookKeeperAdmin`. Note that `verifyLedgerFragment` will still run checks on all other bookies that appear available.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is demonstrated in #2506. As this code currently works, there are a ton of calls made to unavailable bookies with the intent of calculating bad (unavailable) bookies. This proposed change would greatly decrease the number of calls that the auditor and the replicator need to make to calculate which ledgers need replicating.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Added `getUnavailableBookies` method to the `BookKeeperAdmin`. This method could attempt to use caching, but it's not actually called that often, so I think caching might not add complexity without much value.\r\n2. Updated `verifyLedgerFragment` method signature to take a collection of `unavailableBookies`.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2506\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIf these changes are acceptable, I'd like some help identifying the best way to test these changes. I already added some coverage for the `getUnavailableBookies` method, but I haven't explicitly tested the fundamental change this PR proposes.
