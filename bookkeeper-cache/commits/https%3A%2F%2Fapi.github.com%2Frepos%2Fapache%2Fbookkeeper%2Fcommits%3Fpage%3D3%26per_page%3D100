printing useless stacktraces:\r\n- CommandsHelpers -> prevent error on the CLI in case of down bookie (this is a blocker for the usage of the CLI)\r\n- PerChannelBookieClient -> any time you try to connect to a down bookie\r\n- DefaultBookieAddressResolver -> duplicate log line, the error already bubbles up on the caller\n\nReviewers: Flavio Junqueira <fpj@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2538 from

Mapping (ZkBookieRackAffinityMapping) we need to inject the BookieAddressResolver into it.\r\n\r\nThere is not way to do it currently because it is created by the BookKeeper client, and we have to inject the same BookieAddressResolver used by the client itself.\r\n\r\n*Changes*\r\n- add new setBookieAddressResolver method (use 'default' methods in order to preserve backward compatibility\r\n- call the new method in every point in which we instantiate a DNSToSwitchMapping and when we receive an instance at construction time\r\n\r\n*Compatibility*\r\n- this change is 100% compatible with previous versions\n\nReviewers: Rajan Dhabalia <rdhabalia@apache.org>, Anup Ghatage <ghatage@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2519 from

(#2429)\n\nThis feature allows a predefined set of services to be 'whitelisted' to be able to access bookkeeper based on their client certificates. _This feature is disabled by default._\r\n\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nAs BookKeeper and its supported services move to a cloud friendly service based architecture, it becomes of utmost importance to monitor and allow only certain qualified services to be able to access the data in BK.\r\nWe have TLS based authentication, however, any service with the rootCA can access Bookkeeper clusters which is not desirable.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\nTo enable if, we have to set 2 configuration options in server config.\r\n\r\n1.

Set `authorizedRoles` to a comma separated list of roles present in client certificates' OU field.\r\n`authorizedRoles=pulsar-broker-1,pulsar-broker-2`\r\n\r\nRead further for details on how to implement these in your client certificates and how to wire it up.\r\n\r\nSo this feature can be broken down into two parts:\r\n\r\n    Certificate and roles\r\n    Server configuration for authorized roles\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n_Certificate and roles:_\r\nHere is an example of how the SUBJECT field of a final certificate for Apache Pulsar running in the cloud would look like:\r\n\r\n    CN=apache.bookkeeper.org\r\n    O=apache-pulsar\r\n    OU=0:pulsar-broker-role;1:cluster-1\r\n    L=San Francisco\r\n    S=CA\r\n    C=US\r\n\r\nThis shows that this bookkeeper client certificate is owned by the apache pulsar service has the role ‘pulsar-broker-role’ for entities in ‘cluster-1’.\r\nOnly those services with pulsar-broker-role should be able to access it.\r\nWe can add more fields separated by commas to increase the upstream application clusters to be able to access this bookkeeper cluster.\r\n\r\nFor example: `OU=0:herddb-readonlyNode,herddb-readwriteNode;1:herddb-cluster2`\r\n\r\nSuch separation of access based on services is paramount to keeping this secure as many upstream users of BookKeeper are financial institutions, databases and other services.\r\n\r\n_Server configuration for authorized roles_\r\nOnce we have a certificate whose SUBJECT field has the OU attribute with the roles we want to authorize, on the Bookie side, we need to specify which roles are allowed.\r\nWe make this happen by introducing a server configuration option called `authorizedRoles`.\r\nSince we have only static options, this will be set in stone as long as the bookie booted up with it.\r\nIf in case we need to change the allowed roles, we’ll need to stop the bookie, update the configuration file and then restart the bookie.\r\nWe can have multiple roles which are authorized as the OU field can have multiple comma separated values for roles.\r\n\r\nThis is a redo of stale PR #2355 \r\n\r\nMaster Issue:
