Standlone Mode (#2496)\n\n### Motivation\r\n- when you launch \"bookkeeper standalone\" service the system does not take into account the HTTP Server configuration\r\n- the HTTP Server is important because it allows to use the HTTP API https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/latest/admin/http/\r\n- the standalone service is very useful when you are working on client applications (like BKVM)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- consider HTTP server configuration in 'bin/bookkeeper standalone' command\r\n- add default example configuration\r\n- add VertxHttpServer to dependencies of Standalone Module\r\n- the change is basically a copy and paste of this part of Main.java, but applied to the Main class of the Standalone Starter, which is a separate code: https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/server/Main.java#L327\r\n\r\n\r\n ## Verify this change\r\nAfter this change when you run \"bookkeeper standalone\" the HTTP API will be enabled\r\nFor instance you can check the Bookie API

+0100\ncommitter GitHub <noreply@github.com> 1607309359 -0800\n\nStart HTTP Server in Bookie Standlone Mode (#2496)\n\n### Motivation\r\n- when you launch \"bookkeeper standalone\" service the system does not take into account the HTTP Server configuration\r\n- the HTTP Server is important because it allows to use the HTTP API https://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/latest/admin/http/\r\n- the standalone service is very useful when you are working on client applications (like BKVM)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- consider HTTP server configuration in 'bin/bookkeeper standalone' command\r\n- add default example configuration\r\n- add VertxHttpServer to dependencies of Standalone Module\r\n- the change is basically a copy and paste of this part of Main.java, but applied to the Main class of the Standalone Starter, which is a separate code: https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/server/Main.java#L327\r\n\r\n\r\n ## Verify this change\r\nAfter this change when you run \"bookkeeper standalone\" the HTTP API will be enabled\r\nFor instance you can check the Bookie API

connection pool TTL in Github flows (#2460)\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes \"Transfer failed for https://repo.maven.apache.org/...\r\n.jar: Connection reset\" type of failures in Github Flows environment such as\r\n```\r\nError:  Failed to execute goal on project bookkeeper-common: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.bookkeeper:bookkeeper-common:jar:4.12.0-SNAPSHOT: Could not transfer artifact org.jctools:jctools-core:jar:2.1.2 from/to central (https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2): Transfer failed for https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jctools/jctools-core/2.1.2/jctools-core-2.1.2.jar: Connection reset -> [Help 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nSet `maven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds` to 25 seconds.\r\nBesides this, set `maven.wagon.http.retryHandler.count` to 3 retries.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WAGON-545\r\ncontains a recommendation \"Azure users shall set the TTL to 240 seconds or less.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for the 25 second TTL is to ensure that it's shorter than any common\r\nfirewall or NAT timeout. Some NATs have a 30 second idle timeout although\r\nthat is very rare. There shouldn't be harm in using the 25 second TTL since\r\nthe connection pool will be able to pool connections well with a 25 second TTL.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `maven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds` is\r\navailable in the source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/maven-wagon/blob/wagon-3.4.1/wagon-providers/wagon-http-shared/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/wagon/shared/http/AbstractHttpClientWagon.java#L297-L305\r\n\r\nDocumentation for `maven.wagon.http.retryHandler.count` is in\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/wagon/wagon-providers/wagon-http/\r\n\"Any retry handler can only react to exceptions when executing the request and\r\nreceiving the response head. It will not salvage in-flight failures of ongoing\r\nresponse body streams.\" Therefore the retry count setting is a bit\r\ndifferent than expected.

(#2429)\n\nThis feature allows a predefined set of services to be 'whitelisted' to be able to access bookkeeper based on their client certificates. _This feature is disabled by default._\r\n\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nAs BookKeeper and its supported services move to a cloud friendly service based architecture, it becomes of utmost importance to monitor and allow only certain qualified services to be able to access the data in BK.\r\nWe have TLS based authentication, however, any service with the rootCA can access Bookkeeper clusters which is not desirable.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\nTo enable if, we have to set 2 configuration options in server config.\r\n\r\n1.

Set `authorizedRoles` to a comma separated list of roles present in client certificates' OU field.\r\n`authorizedRoles=pulsar-broker-1,pulsar-broker-2`\r\n\r\nRead further for details on how to implement these in your client certificates and how to wire it up.\r\n\r\nSo this feature can be broken down into two parts:\r\n\r\n    Certificate and roles\r\n    Server configuration for authorized roles\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n_Certificate and roles:_\r\nHere is an example of how the SUBJECT field of a final certificate for Apache Pulsar running in the cloud would look like:\r\n\r\n    CN=apache.bookkeeper.org\r\n    O=apache-pulsar\r\n    OU=0:pulsar-broker-role;1:cluster-1\r\n    L=San Francisco\r\n    S=CA\r\n    C=US\r\n\r\nThis shows that this bookkeeper client certificate is owned by the apache pulsar service has the role ‘pulsar-broker-role’ for entities in ‘cluster-1’.\r\nOnly those services with pulsar-broker-role should be able to access it.\r\nWe can add more fields separated by commas to increase the upstream application clusters to be able to access this bookkeeper cluster.\r\n\r\nFor example: `OU=0:herddb-readonlyNode,herddb-readwriteNode;1:herddb-cluster2`\r\n\r\nSuch separation of access based on services is paramount to keeping this secure as many upstream users of BookKeeper are financial institutions, databases and other services.\r\n\r\n_Server configuration for authorized roles_\r\nOnce we have a certificate whose SUBJECT field has the OU attribute with the roles we want to authorize, on the Bookie side, we need to specify which roles are allowed.\r\nWe make this happen by introducing a server configuration option called `authorizedRoles`.\r\nSince we have only static options, this will be set in stone as long as the bookie booted up with it.\r\nIf in case we need to change the allowed roles, we’ll need to stop the bookie, update the configuration file and then restart the bookie.\r\nWe can have multiple roles which are authorized as the OU field can have multiple comma separated values for roles.\r\n\r\nThis is a redo of stale PR #2355 \r\n\r\nMaster Issue:

causes of ZKException\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nEvery time a problem with ZK arises you don't see it in the exception chain of the BKException (in this case ZKException) and you end up with errors like:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException$ZKException: Error while using ZooKeeper\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.SyncCallbackUtils.finish(SyncCallbackUtils.java:83)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.SyncCallbackUtils$SyncAddCallback.addComplete(SyncCallbackUtils.java:251)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback$AddCallback.addCompleteWithLatency(AsyncCallback.java:91)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.PendingAddOp.submitCallback(PendingAddOp.java:430)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle.errorOutPendingAdds(LedgerHandle.java:1784)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.client.LedgerHandle$5.safeRun(LedgerHandle.java:574)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdd a \"cause\" to every ZKException.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThere are very few places that cannot be fixed because they are still using the old callback based mechanism without CompletableFuture.
