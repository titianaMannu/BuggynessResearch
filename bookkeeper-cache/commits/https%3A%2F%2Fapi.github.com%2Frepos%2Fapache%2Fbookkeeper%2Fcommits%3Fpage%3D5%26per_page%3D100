during compaction of a specific entry log, `GarbageCollectorThread` does not perform compaction of other entry logs until the bookie server is restarted. As a result, the number of entry logs continues to increase and eventually it will run out of disk space.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe cause of the compaction stop is that the `compacting` flag remains true if `compactor.compact(entryLogMeta)` throws some exception.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/b2e099bbc7b13f13825fe78ab009ca132cb3a9ba/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/bookie/GarbageCollectorThread.java#L504-L519\r\n\r\nTherefore, fixed `GarbageCollectorThread` so that it set the compaction flag to false even if compaction of a specific entry log fails.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2103\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2121 from massakam/entry-log-compaction, closes #2103","tree":{"sha":"aba323b2bf23affec7f49186ffe047076f6a1be9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/aba323b2bf23affec7f49186ffe047076f6a1be9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1adc93f05954fdb06d7e8b548d606e281831924a/comments","author":{"login":"massakam","id":22543882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQzODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22543882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam","html_url":"https://github.com/massakam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111"}]},{"sha":"6b892a45f02a6d8d0b1d33235d4134d91e3ea111","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo2Yjg5MmE0NWYwMmE2ZDhkMGIxZDMzMjM1ZDQxMzRkOTFlM2VhMTEx","commit":{"author":{"name":"Rajan Dhabalia","email":"rdhabalia@apache.org","date":"2019-07-12T08:03:10Z"},"committer":{"name":"Enrico Olivelli","email":"eolivelli@gmail.com","date":"2019-07-12T08:03:10Z"},"message":"[BK-SERVER] Clean up over-replicated ledgers owned by different bookies\n\n### Motivation\r\nAs described at: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4632\r\n- Sometimes due to overreplication, bookie contains ledgers which are not owned by that bookie anymore and that bookie is not part of the ensemble-list of those ledgers. In this case, GC finds out those overreplicated ledgers and \r\n- deletes their index from dbStorage (rocksDB) and \r\n- tries to delete them from entrylog files.\r\n\r\nHowever, bookie doesn't delete them from entry-log files due to change made in [#870](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/issues/870) where bookie avoids deleting ledger if znode of that ledger exists.\r\n\r\nBecause of that bookie ends up storing large number entrylog files with ledgers which are owned by different bookies.

Hence this PR proposes that the `lastLogMark` is updated to journal EOF instead of an arbitrary LONG.MAX_VALUE. The FileChannel interface defines that the implementors can pass in any long offset and the file handler should return EOF immediately when trying to read it. However it doesn't seem to be working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nUpdated `Journal#setLastLogMark()` method to accept an `scanOffset` instead of constant `LONG.MAX_VALUE`.\r\n\r\nivankelly eolivelli \n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #2105 from karanmehta93/master","tree":{"sha":"53fdaf670022cb7dc1da698abc84fa6eb63e75d7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/53fdaf670022cb7dc1da698abc84fa6eb63e75d7"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/f89e3fbb751fbef7012e695ed5873eade13ba4f5/comments","author":{"login":"karanmehta93","id":6191256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6191256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93","html_url":"https://github.com/karanmehta93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karanmehta93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58"}]},{"sha":"26e8004e6b93f5acaff7f69dba14511a7cf44d58","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjoyNmU4MDA0ZTZiOTNmNWFjYWZmN2Y2OWRiYTE0NTExYTdjZjQ0ZDU4","commit":{"author":{"name":"Charan Reddy Guttapalem","email":"cguttapalem@salesforce.com","date":"2019-05-20T02:53:36Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"guosijie@gmail.com","date":"2019-05-20T02:53:36Z"},"message":"Fix flaky testIOVertexHTTPServerEndpointForARWithPrometheusProvider test\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- in testIOVertexHTTPServerEndpointForARWithPrometheusProvider test\r\nit is not correct to assume that Auditor would have been created and\r\nstarted completely when we complete AutoRecoveryMain.start and see it\r\nstatus as started.

blocking call in gc-thread\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nRight now, we have below 3 issues because of which gc thread gets blocked forever and it can't perform gc-task further. Below issues are mainly related to blocking call while doing zk-operation without timeout. \r\n\r\nbug-fixes:\r\n1. right now, [GC - ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/bookie/ScanAndCompareGarbageCollector.java#L142) passes timeout in millisecond to [LedgerManager](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/meta/LongHierarchicalLedgerManager.java#L166) but it \r\ntakes it as second and again try to convert it in millis so, 30Kms timeout becomes [30M ms timeout](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/util/ZkUtils.java#L245). Sp, fix timeout unit during gc.\r\n\r\n2. Right now, GC makes blocking call to get list of children on ledger znode and sometime zk-call back doesn't comeback which blocks the gc-thread forever. However, recently we added the timeout on the [object-waiting-lock](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/util/ZkUtils.java#L243-L248) which doesn't work because it's in while loop and `object.wait(timeout)` completes without any exception and GC threads keep running in while loop.\r\n\r\n3. add zk-timeout during delete ledgers in bookie else it can also block the GC thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nadd timeout while bk-gc makes zk-call to verify deleted ledgers.\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli

Percentile Calculation in FastCodahale Timer Implementation\n\nThis bugfix for the FastCodahale timer implementation ensures that percentiles provided by a FastSnapshot are calculated correctly even if the total count of events (provided by FastTimer) is out of sync with the recorded events in the percentile buckets.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFastCodahale Timer implementation may miscalculate percentiles if snapshots of values are slightly out of sync, and if only few events have been recorded.\r\n\r\nFastCodahale Timers use fine-grained locking and are meant to tolerate that (some) values change while being recorded or while snapshots are created. Currently, the total count of requests is not synchronized with the number of requests recorded in percentile buckets. If a snapshot is created while the total count of the timer has been incremented beyond the sum of values in the percentile buckets, the percentile calculation may produce wrong values.\r\n\r\nFor example, if 3 percentile values have been recorded, but the overall count is 4, then the percentile calculation would be based on 4 values. This becomes most obvious if a percentile > .75 (e.g. p95) is being calculated. For this, the implementation will try to find 0.95 * 4 values, which is more than the 3 values recorded in the buckets. Since no bucket fulfills the criteria, the bound of the last (overflow) bucket will be returned, i.e. Long.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nFastSnapshots now bases the percentile calculation on the sum of values in the percentile buckets rather than a count provided by the caller (i.e. FastTimer). This ensures that percentiles are calculated correctly without the need of having all counters fully synchronized.\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #2053 \r\n\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <zhaijia@apache.org>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2054 from nicmichael/fast-codahale-bugfix, closes
