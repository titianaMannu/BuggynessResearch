patch adds a binary metadata format and bumps the metadata format\r\nversion to 3. The contents of the binary metadata is the same as the\r\ncontents of the text format for now. The difference is that the binary\r\nis more compact, and the fields can be added to the metadata when\r\nusing the binary format, which isn't possible with the text\r\nformat. With the text format, parsing with a client that didn't\r\nrecognise the new field would fail.\r\n\r\nFor now, the text format (version 2) is still used by default. We will\r\nprovide a tool to allow administrators to bump to version 3.\r\n\r\nSome tests have been modified to provide digest and password to the\r\nbuilder. All protobuf metadata in released versions has had digest and\r\npassword (first protobuf metadata was in release-4.2.0).

dir_*_usage stats are reported as 0 ...\n\nfor read-only bookies after a restart\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixing the Issue #1884:\r\n\r\nWhen a read-only bookie is restarted it keeps reporting `dir_*_usage`\r\nstats as `0` until it becomes writable again.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` only updating\r\n`diskUsages` if there are any writable dirs, or if the total usage\r\ngoes below the low water mark, otherwise relying on previously filled\r\nvalues which are `0` after a bookie is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Change the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` to update `diskUsages`\r\n  even when there are no writable dirs.\r\n* Add new `testLedgerDirsMonitorStartReadOnly` testing this scenario.\r\n* Simplify previous tests checking read-only since `diskUsages`\r\n  are now updated regardless if a bookie is in read-only mode.\r\n\r\njvrao reddycharan \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Charan Reddy Guttapalem

This is\r\nnot safe though, as it there are multiple paths which through which\r\nledger manager factories are created and some may not see this\r\nconfiguration modification. For example, on a new cluster where there\r\nis no preexisting layout, the layout isn't written until after the\r\nledger manager factory has been created.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes LedgerManagerFactory#initialize to explicitly\r\nrequire that the max ledger metadata format is specified in the call.\r\n\r\nMaster issue: #723\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1865 from ivankelly/explicit-max"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/dd684b30c734642dc1347cd931cb483de2ef4888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/dd684b30c734642dc1347cd931cb483de2ef4888","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/dd684b30c734642dc1347cd931cb483de2ef4888/comments","author":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"4c64b3c78d1120d3421a9f50abb9ec9ca97e8864","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4c64b3c78d1120d3421a9f50abb9ec9ca97e8864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/4c64b3c78d1120d3421a9f50abb9ec9ca97e8864"}]}]
