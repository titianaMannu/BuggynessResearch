AbstractDNSToSwitchMapping  is called it\r\nshould do sanity checking of the conf/env. and throw\r\nRuntimeException if things are not valid.\r\n- For RawScriptBasedMapping.validateConf, try executing\r\nthe script with no arguments for sanity check purpose.\r\nHere it is expected that running script with no arguments\r\nwould do sanity check of the script and the env.\r\n\r\n(there are 2

localNode in PlacementPolicy.\n\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n'ignoreLocalNodeInPlacementPolicy' specifies whether to ignore localnode\r\nin the internal logic of placement policy. If it is not possible or useful\r\nto use Bookkeeper client node's (or AutoReplicator) rack/region info. for\r\nplacement policy then it is better to ignore localnode instead of false\r\nalarming with error/warn log lines and metrics.\r\n\r\nIt is not valid to expect rack mapping information to be available for Bookkeeper\r\nclient and ReplicationWorker nodes. So if rackmapping info. is not available\r\nthen it is better to ignore creation of BookieNode by resolving rack information\r\nfor the client localnode. Otherwise it would log unnecessary warn/error log lines\r\nand rack resolution failure metrics.\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Jia Zhai <zhaijia@apache.org>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1917 from reddycharan/ignorelocalnodeinplacementpolicy","tree":{"sha":"8b8aa4e6a10940e605c0c3167c5381d86f87bfd5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/8b8aa4e6a10940e605c0c3167c5381d86f87bfd5"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/d8b894f3a1a60e6df2071e8d8ca89e3e02ba222a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/d8b894f3a1a60e6df2071e8d8ca89e3e02ba222a","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/d8b894f3a1a60e6df2071e8d8ca89e3e02ba222a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/d8b894f3a1a60e6df2071e8d8ca89e3e02ba222a/comments","author":{"login":"reddycharan","id":13989266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTg5MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13989266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan","html_url":"https://github.com/reddycharan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"737f92b2782fc0d027c51ea6bf88cb6b802398db","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/737f92b2782fc0d027c51ea6bf88cb6b802398db","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/737f92b2782fc0d027c51ea6bf88cb6b802398db"}]},{"sha":"737f92b2782fc0d027c51ea6bf88cb6b802398db","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo3MzdmOTJiMjc4MmZjMGQwMjdjNTFlYTZiZjg4Y2I2YjgwMjM5OGRi","commit":{"author":{"name":"Ivan Kelly","email":"ivank@apache.org","date":"2019-01-25T04:09:10Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"guosijie@gmail.com","date":"2019-01-25T04:09:10Z"},"message":"Add semantically meaningful return values to placement policy\n\nCurrently newEnsemble and replaceBookie in EnsemblePlacementPolicy\r\nreturn a apache commons Pair<> with the second argument being a\r\nboolean to denote whether the placement conforms strictly to the\r\npolicy.

patch adds a binary metadata format and bumps the metadata format\r\nversion to 3. The contents of the binary metadata is the same as the\r\ncontents of the text format for now. The difference is that the binary\r\nis more compact, and the fields can be added to the metadata when\r\nusing the binary format, which isn't possible with the text\r\nformat. With the text format, parsing with a client that didn't\r\nrecognise the new field would fail.\r\n\r\nFor now, the text format (version 2) is still used by default. We will\r\nprovide a tool to allow administrators to bump to version 3.\r\n\r\nSome tests have been modified to provide digest and password to the\r\nbuilder. All protobuf metadata in released versions has had digest and\r\npassword (first protobuf metadata was in release-4.2.0).

When reading from a ledger that has `E=W` (every bookie has all the entries), the sticky reads will direct all read request to 1 single bookie in the ensemble.\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1808 from merlimat/single-bookie-per-ledger-read-master"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4c8587715104cde6dbd70d1e7de0fc1853122eda","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/4c8587715104cde6dbd70d1e7de0fc1853122eda","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4c8587715104cde6dbd70d1e7de0fc1853122eda/comments","author":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1a66de0f1841309390261e90d8d0d0af7aa2ede6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/1a66de0f1841309390261e90d8d0d0af7aa2ede6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/1a66de0f1841309390261e90d8d0d0af7aa2ede6"}]},{"sha":"1a66de0f1841309390261e90d8d0d0af7aa2ede6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjoxYTY2ZGUwZjE4NDEzMDkzOTAyNjFlOTBkOGQwZDBhZjdhYTJlZGU2","commit":{"author":{"name":"Matteo Merli","email":"mmerli@apache.org","date":"2019-01-08T20:16:09Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2019-01-08T20:16:09Z"},"message":"Configure Netty allocator in bookie and client\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is based on #1754.

dir_*_usage stats are reported as 0 ...\n\nfor read-only bookies after a restart\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFixing the Issue #1884:\r\n\r\nWhen a read-only bookie is restarted it keeps reporting `dir_*_usage`\r\nstats as `0` until it becomes writable again.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` only updating\r\n`diskUsages` if there are any writable dirs, or if the total usage\r\ngoes below the low water mark, otherwise relying on previously filled\r\nvalues which are `0` after a bookie is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Change the `LedgerDirsMonitor.check` to update `diskUsages`\r\n  even when there are no writable dirs.\r\n* Add new `testLedgerDirsMonitorStartReadOnly` testing this scenario.\r\n* Simplify previous tests checking read-only since `diskUsages`\r\n  are now updated regardless if a bookie is in read-only mode.\r\n\r\njvrao reddycharan \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Charan Reddy Guttapalem
