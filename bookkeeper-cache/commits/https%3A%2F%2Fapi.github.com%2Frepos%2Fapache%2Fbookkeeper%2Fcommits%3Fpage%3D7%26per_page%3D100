rotating entry log files too frequent\n\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n*Motivation*\r\n\r\nA strong behavior was observed when using sorted ledger storage with single entry log manager on production:\r\n\r\n\"the entry log files are rotated very frequently and small entry log files are produced\".\r\n\r\nThe problem was introduced due to #1410.\r\n\r\nAt current entry logger, when a new entry log file is created, EntryLogger will notify its listeners\r\nthat a new entry log file is rotated via [`onRotateEntryLog`](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/bookie/EntryLogManagerBase.java#L152).\r\n\r\nBefore the change in #1410, `SortedLedgerStorage` inherits from `InterleavedLedgerStorage`.\r\nSo when a new entry log file is rotated, `SortedLedgerStorage` is notified.\r\n\r\nHowever after the change in #1410, `SortedLedgerStorage` doesn't inherits `InterleavedLedgerStorage` anymore.\r\nInstead, the relationship is changed to composition. `SortedLedgerStorage` is composed using an interleaved

So the entrylog listener contract was broken. `SortedLedgerStorage` will not receive any `onRotateEntryLog`\r\nnotification any more.\r\n\r\n*Changes*\r\n\r\nWhen `SortedLedgerStorage` initializes, it passes its own entry log listener down to the interleaved ledger storage.\r\nSo entry logger can notify the right person for entry log rotations.\r\n\r\n*Tests*\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover most of the case.

should bypass OSE Threads\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nProfiling of our Bookkeeper Client code for read requests shows that client threads spend half of their time in dispatching requests to OrderedExecutors (just the dispatch itself, not the execution inside OSE): 54% of their CPU time is spent in OrderedExecutor.executeOrdered() (called by LedgerHandle.readEntriesInternalAsync()). The high time spend in request submission to OSE is largely caused by Linux scheduling cost, that is the cost of dispatching the OSE thread to CPU: 42% of total time (3/4th of executeOrdered() time), threads spend in Unsafe.unpark(), which is essentially Linux scheduling/dispatching of another thread.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis change executes read submissions (PendingReadOp) on read-only ledger handles directly inside the client thread instead of submitting them to Ordered Executors.\r\n\r\nTests with a prototype have shown significant improvements in both overall CPU consumption as well as read latency. The additional work client threads have to do (the dispatch of the read requests to netty) is roughly the same as the (saved) dispatch cost to OSE, so the change turns out to be neutral for CPU consumption of client threads. In some experiments, the savings even exceed the additional work, and client threads consume less cpu even though they \"do more\". It also frees up lots of resources in OSE threads. Since it eliminates one context-switch in read submission and also avoids serialization of reads to the same ledger (or ledgers hashing to the same OSE), it also reduces read latency. For a mixed read-write workload (14,000 reads/sec on read-only ledgers, 4,000 writes/sec on another set of ledgers), this change has reduced CPU consumption of OSE threads by 25%, kept CPU consumption of client (and Netty) threads the same, and yielded a 6% improvement of read latency (as measured by BK Client).\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #1791: Read Submission should bypass OSE Threads\r\n\n\nReviewers:

Motivation\r\n\r\nConfiguring the correct JVM memory settings and cache sizes for a BookKeeper cluster should be simplified.\r\n\r\nThere are currently many knobs in Netty or JVM flags for different components and while with a good setup the systems is very stable, it's easy to setup non-optimal configurations which might result in OutOfMemory errors under load.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there should be very minimal configuration required to bring up a BookKeeper cluster that can work under a wide set of traffic loads. In any case, we should prefer to automatically fallback to slower alternatives, when possible, instead of throwing OOM exceptions.\r\n\r\n * Provide a wrapper to have a single unified configuration point for Netty allocator configuration.\r\n * Provide fallback policy when dealing with direct memory OOM errors\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n * This is the first PR. It only contains the allocator wrapper implementation. Subsequent PR will add the changes to use it.\r\n * Added `bookkeeper-common-allocator` module to have a no-dependencues module that can be used directly from Pulsar client library too (which doesn't depend on BK).\r\n\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <guosijie@gmail.com>\nAuthor: Charan Reddy Guttapalem <reddycharan18@gmail.com>\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\nAuthor: Andrey Yegorov

Considering default value for 'auditorPeriodicCheckInterval' is 1 week, it is not uncommon situation.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThats why I'm planning to persist last successful checkAllLedgers execution ctime in ZK, so that next time when a new AR becomes Auditor, it would use that as reference to decide the initial delay value.\r\n\n\nAuthor: cguttapalem <cguttapalem@salesforce.com>\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, Venkateswararao Jujjuri (JV) <None>, Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #1683 from reddycharan/auditormetricslogs","tree":{"sha":"9ea52e8c3db43e67400eda24e3999bf9baa22c42","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/9ea52e8c3db43e67400eda24e3999bf9baa22c42"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/4dac14b7ff3844b1d7e41515162c44f0e1ab9a1f","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4dac14b7ff3844b1d7e41515162c44f0e1ab9a1f","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/4dac14b7ff3844b1d7e41515162c44f0e1ab9a1f","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/4dac14b7ff3844b1d7e41515162c44f0e1ab9a1f/comments","author":{"login":"reddycharan","id":13989266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTg5MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13989266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan","html_url":"https://github.com/reddycharan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reddycharan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"c5cd2aac5430382767f54fd8c3f62c86f6322ab2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/c5cd2aac5430382767f54fd8c3f62c86f6322ab2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/c5cd2aac5430382767f54fd8c3f62c86f6322ab2"}]},{"sha":"c5cd2aac5430382767f54fd8c3f62c86f6322ab2","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1NjpjNWNkMmFhYzU0MzAzODI3NjdmNTRmZDhjM2Y2MmM4NmY2MzIyYWIy","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"guosijie@gmail.com","date":"2018-10-02T22:00:19Z"},"committer":{"name":"GitHub","email":"noreply@github.com","date":"2018-10-02T22:00:19Z"},"message":"[TABLE SERVICES] [PERF] Provides a simple perf tool for testing put and inc performance\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n*Motivation*\r\n\r\nNeed to know what is the performance of table service.\r\n\r\n*Changes*\r\n\r\nProvide a simple perf tool following what RocksDB is doing.

interceptor to attach routing information for table service rpc calls\n\n\r\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n*Motivation*\r\n\r\nCurrently java client deals with request routing and attach routing information before sending the request.\r\nIf we try to apply same mechanism for non-java language clients, it requires implementing this complex\r\nrouting logic for every non-java
