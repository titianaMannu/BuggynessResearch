For writes, latencies of individual bookies are masked by acknowledging the client after a quorum of bookies have replied. However for reads, we don't have any equivalent feature to mask short-term latencies of individual bookies yet (in case of SequenceReadRequests). This PR implements such a feature by reordering reads to prefer bookies with a high probability of being fast over bookies that are potentially slow.\n\n### Changes\nThis change implements a configurable reordering of read requests in Bokkeeper client based on the number of pending requests to each bookie that could service the request. The intention is to mask the latency of one bookie by directing a read request to another bookie that could potentially service the request faster. This should help prevent read time outliers due to bookies that temporarily are responsing slow, for example due to Java garbage collection, compaction, or any other kind of hickup. Unlike the implementation for Issue #709, this algorithm quickly reacts to both an or decrease increase in queue length of a bookie relative to others, and allows to redirect requests long before they would hit the speculativeReadTimeout. Once the problem is resolved (e.g. Java GC finished), it will quickly direct requests to the previously \"slow\" bookie as its queue length decreases.\n\nReordering of reads is based on a threshold of relative queue length to other bookies. Setting the threshold very low will more frequently reorder the read set and potentially result in better latency, but will also reduce data affinity of reads. Reads send to other than the preferred bookie have a low chance to be served from file system cache on that bookie, and will likely result in a physical read. Small thresholds therefore shuffle read requests more among bookies and may lead to reduced file system cache reach and increased physical reads on disks. A larger timeout will maintain data affinity and avoid above problems, but only kick in once a bookie has built-up a considerable queue of requests. It therefore masks only slightly larger outliers, and leads to overall better efficiency.\n\nMaster Issue: #1489\n\nAuthor: Nicolas Michael <nmichael@salesforce.com>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #1504 from nicmichael/ReadReordering, closes #1489","tree":{"sha":"e22cfac8749bcddae6e9b3fa13008109ad118f03","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/e22cfac8749bcddae6e9b3fa13008109ad118f03"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/134a6c25a846731dc2ad0dc6c3e848170557b7b9/comments","author":{"login":"nicmichael","id":27270046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjcwMDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27270046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael","html_url":"https://github.com/nicmichael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicmichael/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff"}]},{"sha":"9f55f78815c80d6b335d8e1cf6fd91196aeb8cff","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5ZjU1Zjc4ODE1YzgwZDZiMzM1ZDhlMWNmNmZkOTExOTZhZWI4Y2Zm","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-14T00:35:34Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-06-14T00:35:34Z"},"message":"Allow to configure read-only mode in ZooKeeperClient\n\nUnderlying `Zookeeper` instance has an option to specify the client is fine to remain connected when the ZK quorum is lost, just in read-only mode.\n\nWe should expose the \"allow read-only mode\" option in `ZooKeeperClient`.\n\nOne example of use case for this flag is when connecting to a ZK ensemble that is just used for configuration/metadata store, in which no ephemeral nodes are used. It's therefore better to keep the connection with ZK and be able to keep reading (possibly stale) data from ZK rather than no read at all. Concrete use case is for ZK session for Pulsar global ZK ensemble, where we read configuration data and we don't really need to have a valid session when brokers are trying to read.\n\nAuthor: Sijie

It would be better to consolidate all these tools in one place `bookkeeper-tools`.\n\nThis is a PR to prepare moving `stream/cli` to be part of bookkeeper-tools.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- Abstract the CLI

handling PRs made to branches\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrent precommit CI jobs uses `master` as target branch for applying the pull requests.\nHowever pull

However sometime it is also problematic when you reference this snapshot version in other projects, subsequent changes in bookkeeper might potentially break those projects.\n\n*Solution*\n\nUpdate the CI to provide a mechanism to publish a snapshot version with gitsha information. so it can publish a snapshot version that is pinned to the given gitsha. so the projects can safely use a snapshot version for development without worrying bookkeeper changes break it.\n\n*NOTES*\n\nThe mechanism is a manual operation.

and storage container grpc proxy\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis is a subsequent change after apache/bookkeeper#1428.\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrent almost every grpc requests are wrapped into `StorageContainerRequest` and their responses\nare wrapped into `StorageContainerResponse`. It makes things a bit complicated on adding new grpc\nservices.\n\n*Changes*\n\nTo simplify things, this PR introduces two functionalities for simplifying dispatching container requests/responses.\n\n1) *StorageContainerClientInterceptor*: A grpc `ClientInterceptor` that stamps container information (currently is `scId`) into the requests' metadata before sending the requests to the wire.\n\n2) A simple grpc reverse proxy to dispatch grpc requests to the channels provided by a `ChannelFinder`.\n\n*Tests*\n\n1. Existing unit tests covered client interceptor changes.\n2. Introduced a `stream-storage-tests-common` module to include common classes that would be used for testing.\n3. Introduced a `PingPongService` for testing reverse proxy : unary/client-streaming/server-streaming/bidi-streaming.\n\nMaster Issue: #1205\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1430 from sijie/interceptor_container_requests","tree":{"sha":"7c77be2cf0166f50ceaa889e000dbb7437ed9be1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/7c77be2cf0166f50ceaa889e000dbb7437ed9be1"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/bff7106b307ee9a2cac041c1f1048478e03e6b24/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4"}]},{"sha":"6bfad08b4851406c219c1b5dc445c33453e7ecc4","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo2YmZhZDA4YjQ4NTE0MDZjMjE5YzFiNWRjNDQ1YzMzNDUzZTdlY2M0","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-25T07:58:26Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-25T07:58:26Z"},"message":"Issue #1434: Checkstyle is not executed at some modules\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCheckstyle was supposed to run at `validate` phase for every modules.

much convenient to start the service as one additional component with bookie, just like how we start `AutoRecovery` along with bookie.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- include `stream/server` module as part of bookkeeper server/all binary distributions\n- abstract `StorageServer` to allow controlling whether to start bookie or not\n- provide a ServerLifecycleComponent of `StorageServer`, so it can be used as an extra component of bookie\n\n*Tests*\n\n- improve the integration tests to start table service as part of bookie containers\n- move `LocationClientTest` to container based integration

However the scripts and configurations for dlog and table-service modules are still in their own modules. It is inconvenient and confusing. This change mainly refactor current bookkeeper script to make it reusable for other modules.\n\n*Code Change*\n\nThe main changes are:\n\n- abstract the common logic in `bin/bookkeeper` to `bin/common.sh`. These common logics include:\n   * common definitions on environment variables, such jvm settings, bk conf, log4j conf, classpath and such.\n   * common functions can be reusable, such as find jars, add maven dependencies.\n- simplify `bin/bookkeeper` and `bin/bookkeeper-cli` by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n- remove `stream/distributedlog/core/bin/dlog` to `bin/dlog` and simplify it by reusing `bin/common.sh`\n\n*Tests*\n\nMost of the changes in this PR are tests to ensure this script refactor is done correctly.\n\n- introduced a module `tests/scripts` for testing all the bash scripts in bookkeeper project. This module uses [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) for testing bash scripts. This gives a good test coverage on `bin/common.sh`.\n\n- add a few CLI smoketests under `tests/integration/smoke` to smoke test all CLI tools, including `bin/bookkeeper shell`, `bin/bookkeeper-cli` and `bin/dlog`. This makes sure all the CLI scripts work well after refactor.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1407 from sijie/include_dlog_library","tree":{"sha":"aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/aed837a794eae71e320326e211ffeeb0ac4eebd9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/7446d5c5d999c88de3cf2b9a36d793295c751a91/comments","author":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312"}]},{"sha":"92591733c8b778f63cd71a00b2c7ed2c69c41312","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo5MjU5MTczM2M4Yjc3OGY2M2NkNzFhMDBiMmM3ZWQyYzY5YzQxMzEy","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-15T18:12:54Z"},"message":"ISSUE #1403: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown on readLastAddConfirmedAndEntry\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThere are two bugs in `ReadLastAddConfirmedAndEntry`:\n\n1) a regression was introduced by #657. the long poll read op is attempting to long-poll reading lac. since lac is stored across ensemble, so the retry logic assumes it will attempt over all the bookies in the ensemble. however #657 use a `write-quorum-size` write set for tracking those attempts. this leads to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException reported at #1403.

The integrate tests added in this PR can also catch this issue.\n\ndisclaim: twitter uses long poll reads but never uses `ensembleSize > writeQuorumSize`. so this is not a problem for dlog users.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- introduce a `getWriteSetForLongPoll` call that uses `ensembleSize` for building the write set. this would address problem 1)\n- fix the assignment of

http server\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nCurrently metrics provider and http admin endpoint are isolated due to the way how things are modularized.\nThis requires two ports to be used, one is for metrics provider to expose metrics, while the other one is used by\nhttp admin endpoint for expose admin endpoints.\n\nWhen implementing a bookkeeper operator on k8s, it becomes confusing on managing those ports and do health checks.\nIt would be good to allow export metrics in same http admin endpoint if it is enabled.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- Introduce a method `writeAllMetrics` in stats provider to allow stats provider exporting metrics.\n- Add a `MetricsService` in bookie http service and export stats provider's metrics under `/metrics` endpoint.\n\nThis

In this case we are simulating a regular sync'd write to the journal choosen for the ledger.\n\nAuthor: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\nAuthor: eolivelli <eolivelli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>, JV Jujjuri <vjujjuri@salesforce.com>\n\nThis closes #1375 from eolivelli/bp14-simple-forceledger","tree":{"sha":"546606a9ad1fb7bcfebcc449ccfa80fc6a764532","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/trees/546606a9ad1fb7bcfebcc449ccfa80fc6a764532"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/git/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/3bd411910b3651e5dcb9df44d1f77cd6f6cd0ca6/comments","author":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bookkeeper/commits/8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/commit/8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5"}]},{"sha":"8e7583b4c691dc44bb9057a2fe472a44184346a5","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MTU3NTk1Njo4ZTc1ODNiNGM2OTFkYzQ0YmI5MDU3YTJmZTQ3MmE0NDE4NDM0NmE1","commit":{"author":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-07T08:50:29Z"},"committer":{"name":"Sijie Guo","email":"sijie@apache.org","date":"2018-05-07T08:50:29Z"},"message":"[TABLE SERVICE] a zk based storage container controller\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThe original storage container \"controller\" was written in helix. The helix controller's placement is kind of not assuming any properties of shared storage. however the table service is leverage bookkeeper's as its segment/log store. the table service is built in a more `stateless` way, where a storage container can be moved between servers in a much lightweight way.\n\nAlso helix codebase is a bit large, if we eventually going to eliminate zookeeper, the cost of switching it off helix will be much expensive. so this PR is introducing a simple zk based controller for assigning storage containers to servers.\n\n*Solution*\n\nIn this zk base solution, it is comprised of 3 parts: server registration, cluster & storage controller, storage container manager.\n\n**registration**\n\nthis solution leverages existing registration client/manager interfaces. so each storage server registers itself under `/stream/servers/available`.\n\n**cluster & storage controller**\n\nA storage server is elected as a the leader, which runs a ClusterController. The cluster controller reads cluster metadata from zookeeper (the cluster metadata includes like how many containers available in the cluster), and use a storage controller to compute an assignment plan as the ideal state for container assignment mapping, and then update the assignment mapping to zookeeper under `/stream/assignment`.\n\n**storage container manager**\n\nEach storage server runs a storage container manager, which watches the assignment plan in zookeeper. The cluster controller updates the assignment plan. Once it receives watches/updates from the assignment plan that computed by cluster controller, the storage container manager will align itself to the ideal assignment map by starting/stopping storage containers.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1392 from
