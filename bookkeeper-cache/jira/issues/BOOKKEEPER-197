The current setup doesn't pick up the zookeeper location.\n\nI think the bookkeeper settings are missed in default hedwig server configuration file. so the bookkeeper client could not pick up the right zookeeper location. I would try to add them in the default hedwig server configuration file.\n{quote}\n\nmy previous comment is not right. did some comparison between hedwig console and PubSubServer. I found that PubSubServer uses zookeeper server setting in hub server, while HedwigAdmin uses zookeeper server setting from bookkeeper. so you couldn't locate zookeeper when zookeeper is remote and you didn't put bookkeeper server setting in.\n\nI add a change in HedwigAdmin to let it use setting from hub server configuration, which matches what hub server does.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hustlmsp","name":"hustlmsp","key":"hustlmsp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sijie Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-03-31T06:51:34.964+0000","updated":"2012-03-31T06:51:34.964+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548766/comment/13245136","id":"13245136","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"This patch looks mostly ok to me, except that the log statement following the new ZooKeeper(...) call seems to be using the wrong values.
