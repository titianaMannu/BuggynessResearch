Interestingly, there is a mismatch between the synchronous version of delete ledger and the asynchronous version. The asynchronous version propagates the zookeeper error code, but the synchronous one doesn't, it simply logs the error code. The asynchronous version seems to be leaking some info about the internals.\n\n@uma,sijie At the time we were designing the api, we've set as one of our guidelines to have synchronous calls indicating an error by throwing an exception and asynchronous calls indicating errors with a return code. If we make the change Uma proposes, then we will be breaking this guideline and symmetry. Do you guys feel that it is a strong enough reason to break compatibility? Of course, doing it earlier is better, so now it is a good time to talk about it. Also, I think that a change that breaks compatibility should be in 5.0, no?\n\nWith respect to the issue of this jira, I believe we would return true in the case the ledger has already been deleted and return false if the operation really fails, right? Throwing an exception compared to just returning a boolean enables us to convey more information about the error, even if we are not conveying a lot right now.

For this version, fix could be like this suggestion. So, that we can maintain compatiobility for 4.x versions and also will be able to indicate the users about the status with correct exception.\n\nFor version 5.0, may be we can think/ discuss more about this API behavior change. Since we don't want to break the compatibility in 4.x versions, Let's go ahead with above suggestion? If yes, it may be better to move to separate JIRA about the below discussions then?\n{quote}\nI think the proposal is returning true when deleting the ledger successfully, returning false when the ledger doesn't exist, throwing exception when encountering exceptions during deletion.

If we make the change Uma proposes, then we will be breaking this guideline and symmetry. Do you guys feel that it is a strong enough reason to break compatibility? Of course, doing it earlier is better, so now it is a good time to talk about it. Also, I think that a change that breaks compatibility should be in 5.0, no?\n{quote}\n\nThanks,\nUma","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=umamaheswararao","name":"umamaheswararao","key":"umamaheswararao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Uma Maheswara Rao G","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-30T10:22:58.720+0000","updated":"2012-05-30T10:22:58.720+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558515/comment/13285579","id":"13285579","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"+1 on NoSuchLedgerExistsException.
