A lot of the documentation referred to a benchmark application which doesn't exist in the source tree, so I removed it. \n\n2.\nhw.bash does a whole load of things. It downloads zk & bk. This will be unnecessary once zk 3.4.0 is released, which our 3.4.0 release is predicated on. It sets up java. I think we should assume that people who want to run bookkeeper/hedwig already have java. It sets up yourkit, but assumes a hardcoded location. It's easier just to run <yourkit>/bin/yjp.sh -attach. It has a custom command for changing logging levels. The scripts I attached allow you to specify a custom log4j.properties at runtime. Lastly, it sets up ssh keys, sudo, limits etc. This is downright dangerous to allow a script to do. \n\n3. I've removed most of the pom.xml changes as they refer to the packaging. I'll open another JIRA for them. The one thing I have removed is the automatic generation of giant jars with all dependencies. With the scripts these are not required to run bookkeeper or hedwig. For redistribution we the packaging jira I just mentioned will package the dependencies in a way that the scripts can pick them up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-08-10T14:18:34.712+0000","updated":"2011-08-10T14:18:34.712+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12512212/comment/13085344","id":"13085344","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"+1, looks good to me.
