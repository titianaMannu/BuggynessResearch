I feel, would great pass exceptions back to the client. How does it sound?\n# Also, earlier I guess BookKeeper(conf) was throwing the following exception back to the client, but in the patch it is suppressing.

This is a change to fix a intermittent failure of the test, due to the change in how BOOKKEEPER-258 made timeouts work. Before 258, we set the timeout and when it hit, we just killed everything. Now we set the timeout, and when it triggers, we check if that amount of time has passed with the request outstanding and if so error the request. As the timeout timer is set on the connection and not the individual requests, and the requests can be made a couple of ms after the connection is set up, sometimes it can take 2 timeout periods for the requests to be timed out. This change ensures that this happens.\n\n2. This is true. I think the overall problem here is that its not possible to set a Watcher on a ZooKeeper without overriding the previous one. This means that there's no real clean way to say \"Don't process anything on this zk until it has connected\". \n\n@Rakesh\n1. I'll look into how best to fail fast and generate a new patch.\n2.
