Have I misunderstood it?\n\nAs I understand, the reason why Ivan disagrees due to the following issue:\n\nbq.The solution in the patch is actually broken. Bookie#start is called before NIOServerFactory#start, which means that if you try to start a bookie on a machine where the bookie is already running, the running bookie's availability znode is deleted, the new bookie creates one, the new bookie tries to start NIOServerFactory and fails as the socket is already bound, so crashes, taking it's availability znode with it. The initial bookie is now running, without a availability znode, so noone can contact it.\n\nThis problem is resolved after the swapping of NIO and bookie#start. Now the chance of corrupting already running bookie is no more. So is the reason I continued with znode deletion during bookie#registration. \n\n\nHi Ivan, please correct me if I interpreted your comments wrongly.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-06-26T09:36:17.760+0000","updated":"2012-06-26T09:36:17.760+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12560438/comment/13401279","id":"13401279","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hi Rakesh, Check please the followup comments starting with this one:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-294?focusedCommentId=13295044&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13295044\n\nI ack that I see no explicit agreement, though, but not deleting is what I gathered from the followup comments.
