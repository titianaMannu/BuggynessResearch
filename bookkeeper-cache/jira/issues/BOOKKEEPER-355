But it is a bit different. NoSuchLedger is due to a new bookie is selected to do recovery add, but the new bookie failed to add the entry. so next recovery operation would encountered NoSuchLedger exception and close ledger.\n\nThe test case you added seems OK for me. A few comments about your patch:\n1) it would be better to not add separated read code path in LedgerRecoveryOp. You could still leverage PendingReadOp, but added a method #initiateWithRecovery() to tell PendingReadOp is a recovery read.\n2) I don't like the idea to send all request to the quorum and wait all responses. It is totally bad in a distributed system that you could not depends on all bookies are alive. And I think NoSuchLedger is a rare case, so how about reading the first bookie, if it responded with NoSuchLedger, we had to check next bookie until we received all bookies in quorum responded NoSuchLedger. Then we know it is NoSuchLedger and finished recovery and close it.\n\nAs the explanation, it is a kind of special read strategy used for recovery read. so I think this jira could leverage a clean ReadStrategy we introduced in BOOKKEEPER-336 to provide a recovery read strategy.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hustlmsp","name":"hustlmsp","key":"hustlmsp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sijie Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-09T00:50:39.178+0000","updated":"2012-08-09T00:50:39.178+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12602144/comment/13431599","id":"13431599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hi Vinay its good catch.\n\n@Sijie\nI like the approach.

As Ivan mentioned, concurrent closes have Ledger#resolveConflicts() mechanism and would help to handle most of the cases. I could also see one possible case of concurrency and what you guys feel about the following race condition:\n\n1) Assume, c1 & c2 both initiates recovery and sees the failure of C. \n\n2) Say c1 would try replacing C with D and at same time c2 would try replacing C with E. \n\n3) Again assume, c1 & c2 sends the metadata update request simulataneously.\n\nConsider c1 would succeeded and c2 recevies the metadataversion exception. Now c2 will enters into LedgerHandle#resolveconflicts(), here its checking whether C (failed bookie) exists in the new zkmetadata. As c1 would previously modified the metadata (C with D), c2 will be thinking the failed bookie is replaced with E and go ahead with unnecessary writes to E. Below is existing code:\n{code}\n             metadata.setVersion(newMeta.getVersion());\n            // Resolve the conflicts if zk metadata still contains failed bookie\n            if (newMeta.currentEnsemble.get(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex).equals(\n                    ensembleInfo.addr)) {\n            } else {\n                // the failed bookie has been replaced\n                blockAddCompletions.decrementAndGet();\n                unsetSuccessAndSendWriteRequest(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex);\n            }\n{code}\n\n\nIMHO, we would add the following checks in the LedgerHandle#resolveConflicts() for \"failed bookie has been replaced in ZK\":\n\n{code}\n            if (newMeta.currentEnsemble.get(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex).equals(\n                    ensembleInfo.addr)) {\n                 .....\n            }else if (metadata.currentEnsemble.get(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex)\n                    .equals(newMeta.currentEnsemble\n                            .get(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex))) {\n                // the failed bookie has been replaced\n                blockAddCompletions.decrementAndGet();\n                unsetSuccessAndSendWriteRequest(ensembleInfo.bookieIndex);\n            }else {\n                // some other client would have replaced the failed\n                // bookie with new one. Hence failing!\n                ......\n            }\n{code}\n\n-Rakesh","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rakeshr","name":"rakeshr","key":"rakeshr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rakeshr&avatarId=29267"},"displayName":"Rakesh Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-12-17T09:36:04.544+0000","updated":"2012-12-17T09:36:04.544+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12602144/comment/13533978","id":"13533978","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"[~rakeshr] In this case, the code path you're talking about doesn't get executed, as we don't use ChangeEnsembleCb during recovery with my patch.
