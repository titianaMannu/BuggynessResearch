observed the following behavior when some of the bookkeeper jobs were abruptly restarted a few times.\n\nWhen the bookies and hedwig hubs were restarted, the hubs tried to query the entries for a particular topic, but an exception was always returned and the reads never completed successfully. \n\nEventually, we found that the ledger from which entries couldn't be read actually had 2 index files on disk. We use multiple ledger directories. The first file was in ledger directory number 2 and had a size of 0. The other file which actually contained all the data was in directory 4. \n\nIt doesn't seem right that one ledger has 2 index files. Also, the findIndexFile() function returns the first found ledger index file. Should this be patched to \n1) Throw an exception if more than one file exists (if that's the expected behavior)\n2) Do something else?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nEdit: \nFor another ledger, there were 2 files again, created within a minute of each other, on separate directories and with the same size. \n\nI ran bin/bookie shell ledger -m <ledger_number>. For the most recent file, all entries were N/A, but the other file had all the actual entries. \n\nSo, returning the most recent file might not be the best approach? Should we perhaps check all files?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12314123":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12314122":null,"customfield_12314121":null,"customfield_12314120":null,"customfield_12314129":null,"customfield_12314524":null,"customfield_12314128":null,"summary":"Bookkeeper doesn't search all ledger directories for index files.","customfield_12314130":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"customfield_12311024":null,"customfield_12314138":null,"customfield_12314137":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12314136":null,"customfield_12314135":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12314134":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12314132":null,"customfield_12314131":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603975/comment/13437851","id":"13437851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hustlmsp","name":"hustlmsp","key":"hustlmsp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sijie Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am just thinking why there are two index files generated for a same ledger. since the fileInfoCache is protected in synchronized blocks to avoid two FileInfo are put in different directories for same ledger, if there is only one bookie daemon thread, this is case should not happen.\n\nIf there are two processes running at the same time, said one process is shutting down, which tries to flush the index to generate an index file; the other process is starting up, which replays journal files, it would find that there is no index file, and generate a new index file in different dir. but this case would only happend before BOOKKEEPER-294, which replays journal files before setting up NIOServer.\n\n@Aniruddha, which version of bookkeeper are you using?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hustlmsp","name":"hustlmsp","key":"hustlmsp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sijie Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-20T13:32:11.458+0000","updated":"2012-08-20T13:32:11.458+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603975/comment/13437981","id":"13437981","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=i0exception","name":"i0exception","key":"i0exception","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aniruddha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, that makes sense.
