Original newConnectedZK method events from ZKutil will not handle any expire events. So, just before reregistering if it gets expired event, we may miss that event handling.\nlater operations may thow conn loss exception and may miss proper cleanup.\nSo, how about having isConnected check after reregistration of watcher?\nif ZK is in non connected state and ZK state has expired event then shutdown as watcher event does the same. This way we will not miss any events right?

Could you please give your opinion on the following.\n\n{quote}There will be a small race here, which may resulted to miss the events.\nRace is between event and reregistration. Original newConnectedZK method events from ZKutil will not handle any expire events. So, just before reregistering if it gets expired event, we may miss that event handling.\n later operations may thow conn loss exception and may miss proper cleanup.{quote}\nActually the window gap between Syncconnected event and Expired event is the sessiontimeout configured for the client. I couldn't see any race between Syncconnected event and expiry event. I agree there could be a high chance of sending Disconnected event to the previous watcher in ZKUtil, but Bookie doesn't have any event handling other than just logging.\n\nConsider in corner case where the client is very busy(in GCing or other cases) and got expired before registering new watcher. In this case anyway down the layer, after instantiation, bookie is using zkclient for checking env(as shown below code) here it would get ZKConnectionLossException and consequently would get shutdown.\n{code}\n        this.zk = instantiateZookeeperClient(conf);\n        checkEnvironment(this.zk);\n{code}\n\nSo IMHO, we can continue without having anymore extra checks.

So, I don't feel it is correct to depending on that check. If tomorrow we change the check env conditions, no one will came back to this position and care about this zk connection race right.
