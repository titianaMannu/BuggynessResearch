You could just do awaitingUninterruptibly() on the channel.close call in PerChannelBookieClient#close for the same effect. Also, the fact that you call close on the group rather than the individual channels means PerChannelBookieClient#close gets bypassed completely, which could be a potential source of bugs, as someone could put cleanup in there that never gets called. \n\nWho calls the halt() code in the test code? It might be a good idea to move the releaseExternalResources() call into a new thread to allow halt to be called from callbacks. \n{code}\n  public void halt() throws InterruptedException {\n    bookieClient.close();\n    bookieWatcher.halt();\n    if (ownChannelFactory) {\n      new Thread() {\n        public void run() {\n          channelFactory.releaseExternalResources();\n        }\n      }.start();\n    }\n    if (ownZKHandle) {\n      zk.close();\n    }\n    callbackWorker.shutdown();\n    mainWorkerPool.shutdown();\n  }\n{code}\n\nAlso, indentation in general is inconsistent over BK, 4 space in some places, 2 space in others. We should standardize. It may even be a good idea to go through the whole tree and reindent now, rather than later when such an action would destroy history (we currently don't have very much history since the split). \n\nFinally, I think halt() should be called close(). halt() seems to imply that the bookkeeper service is being stopped, not that you're just closing your connection to it.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-06-17T10:15:52.595+0000","updated":"2011-06-17T10:15:52.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12499276/comment/13050961","id":"13050961","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"The trunk code in BookiClient.close() is this:\n\n{noformat}\nfor (PerChannelBookieClient channel: channels.values()){\n            channel.close();\n        }\n{noformat}\n\nand I have just replaced it with channelGroup.close().

It is actually not even necessary to connect before invoking an operation, since we call connectIfNeededAndDoOp() upon every addEntry and readEntry. It works even without the else block in your version of the patch. There are also a few other changes unrelated to this issue, like a change to pom.xml and fixed typos.

Since these messages only appear when we shut down the object, I don't see a problem with keeping them, but at the same time I don't feel strongly about removing them if you feel they are unnecessary.
