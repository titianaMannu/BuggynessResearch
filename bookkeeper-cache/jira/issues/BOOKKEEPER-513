The solution is to send a closeSubscription message for the simple channel manager as well as with the multiplex client.

It's a canary.\n\nI understand, and I also understand that these issues are difficult to test. However, tests that fail intermittently tend to cause confusion because there could be a long gap between reintroducing the bug and spotting it in a failed test. Again, I'm not entirely convinced that it is a good thing to have tests like this, but if you feel we should, it is fine with me. \n\nOne point I'd like to make is that it would be good to differentiate errors and failures. If a test is written to capture a given bug, it should add to the number of failures, not the number of errors. Adding to the number of errors should happen only in the case of unexpected events, say the disk is full or a network port is already used.
