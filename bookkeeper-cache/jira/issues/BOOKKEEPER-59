The synchronization won't hit performance because the only call to #connect is already in a synchronized block. However if someone makes the call from somewhere else in the future, it'll still be safe.\n\nPerChannelBookieClient#connected and PerChannelBookieClient#connectionAttemptInProgress have been rolled into one enum, as these are mutually exclusive states. \n\nI've moved the check of PerChannelBookieClient#connectionAttempt into #connect() as this seems like a better place for it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-09-06T14:30:31.556+0000","updated":"2011-09-06T14:30:31.556+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520701/comment/13106497","id":"13106497","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"+1, thanks, Ivan.
