If the OrderedSafeExecutor is stopped after the request has submitted, but the request also submits to the executor, then the request callback will never get completed.\n\nFor example, if you have an add request. The request is submitted to the executor fine, but then the executor is killed. The request goes to the server. Once if comes back, PerChannelBookieClient#messageReceived will get a RejectExecution when it tries to handle it, and your request is hung. I tried to build on Rakesh's patch originally, but there's a hell of a lot of cases of this, so I considered it cleaner to have a single point to cancelling callbacks.\n\nI'm not particularly comfortable with this change either, with 4.2.2 so close.

I'm not sure it can be done cleanly though. Really we should never be passing the client callback past the client class (BookKeeper/LedgerHandle) at all. We should have a callback thread in the client, that all client callbacks run in, and the client internals should submit to this thread when the calls are finished.
