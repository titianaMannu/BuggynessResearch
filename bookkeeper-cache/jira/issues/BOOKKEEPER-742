This is a comment in the patch:\n\n{noformat}\n     * For example, if in a E3Q2, only 1 entry is written and the last bookie\n     * in the ensemble fails, nothing has been written to it, so nothing needs to be\n     * recovered. But if the second to last bookie fails, we've now lost quorum for\n     * the second entry, so it's impossible to see if the second has been written or\n     * not.\n{noformat}\n\nThe problem here is that you've lost too many bookies, so it is possible that you've lost data and consequently the ledger is bad. Say that entry has been successfully written and acknowledged. In this case, we can't recover 1 and the ledger is bad, but we can't distinguish the case you're describing from the one I just presented.\n\nAlso, for completeness, I just wanted to confirm that if 3 or more entries have been written, then we would be able to spot that the ledger is really bad because we would be able to see entry 2, but not 1. \n\nOne small point about the patch. This method isFinalEnsembleOpenAndAvailable, which seems to be key to this patch, returns true in the case the ledger metadata says closed.
