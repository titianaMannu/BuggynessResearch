There is actually a test for it, BookieReadWriteTest#testReadFromOpenLedger, but the @Test annotation is missing from it so it never gets run. Also, the actual checking code seems to be wrong, as it tries to read from lh, not lhOpen (line 861). Could you break the fix for this problem into a single patch along with the fix for the test and ill commit that as BOOKKEEPER-91. \n\n2) This is unrelated to 1) so should be in a separate JIRA. Also, im unsure the race you describe can occur. ReadLastConfirmedOp#readEntryComplete is already synchronized.\n\n3) Actually this could go into BOOKKEEPER-91. However, I think a better solution may be to do a ReadLastConfirmedOp in the else part of LedgerOpenOp#processResult. \n{code}\n        if(!unsafe) {\n            lh.recover(new GenericCallback<Void>() {\n            @Override\n            public void operationComplete(int rc, Void result) {\n                if (rc != BKException.Code.OK) {\n                    cb.openComplete(BKException.Code.LedgerRecoveryException, null, LedgerOpenOp.this.ctx);\n                } else {\n                    cb.openComplete(BKException.Code.OK, lh, LedgerOpenOp.this.ctx);\n                }\n            }\n       } else {\n           lh.asyncReadLastConfirmed(new ReadLastConfirmedCallback() {\n               void readLastConfirmedComplete(int rc, long lastConfirmed, Object ctx) {\n                   lh.lastAddConfirmed = lh.lastAddPushed = lastConfirmed;\n                   cb.complete(rc, LedgerOpenOp.this.ctx);\n               }\n           });\n       }\n{code}\n\nThis way, a non recovery ledger will be able to read entries up to the point it was opened and no further. I think this should be correct behaviour, as otherwise it could be possible for the ledger to read an entry which hasn't been confirmed to the writer. If it hasn't been confirmed to the writer and the writer closes at that point. Which means the reader can read more than the writer, which I don't think affects correctness, but is a little ugly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ikelly","name":"ikelly","key":"ikelly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Kelly","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2011-10-25T15:44:56.296+0000","updated":"2011-10-25T15:44:56.296+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528680/comment/13135611","id":"13135611","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hustlmsp","name":"hustlmsp","key":"hustlmsp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sijie Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ivan,\n\n> 2) This is unrelated to 1) so should be in a separate JIRA.

The changes should be tested also. The whole reason the bug exists is a lack of testing in the first place.
