OpenJPA can be used as a stand-alone POJO\n+   persistence layer, or it can be integrated into any EJB3.0 compliant\n+   container and many lightweight frameworks. This release of OpenJPA is 100%\n+   compliant with the JPA specification.\n+\n+   Additional information on the OpenJPA project may be found at the project\n+   web site: http://openjpa.apache.org\n+\n+License\n+\n+   Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+   contributor license agreements.
