Some of the sub-projects already had the svn:ignore property for the target directory, but\nnot all of them.  I also updated the properties to ignore any \"dot files\" at the top most OpenJPA (ie. trunk)\nlevel.  This will help with ignoring the metadata files associated with IDE's such as Eclipse (.classpath and\n.project) and NetBeans (.netbeans).\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@433670 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"6bfc93bc93928eaf7b35231c1e7b267c64401230","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/6bfc93bc93928eaf7b35231c1e7b267c64401230"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/d13c9fa4f6d136e83c86d4c0c7259149c5dd9857","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/d13c9fa4f6d136e83c86d4c0c7259149c5dd9857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/d13c9fa4f6d136e83c86d4c0c7259149c5dd9857","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/d13c9fa4f6d136e83c86d4c0c7259149c5dd9857/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"6f0a7f67da77101bd7bf2d82ee518e40485b279f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/6f0a7f67da77101bd7bf2d82ee518e40485b279f","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/6f0a7f67da77101bd7bf2d82ee518e40485b279f"}],"stats":{"total":0,"additions":0,"deletions":0},"files":[]}
