notation prefixes. Checking in patch for Ben Short, along with minor whitespace reformatting and a small tweak to reduce computation if branch logic in correctName() will not use the calculated name.\n\nThe initial patch included a test for fields that would end up having duplicate names after truncation. The code, however, does not do anything to resolve / avoid duplicates. To make it work, we would need to change MappingDefaultsImpl.correctName() to take a ValueMapping as an argument, and do a two-pass algorithm to check for other fields that would turn into duplicates. Even doing this will not be foolproof, as a duplicate column might come from a subclass or an embedded class. Since this option is not enabled by default anyways, and the duplicate error would become evident during testing / schema creation, I do not believe that it would be worthwhile to spend much time addressing this.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openjpa/trunk@592319 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"10573bde039046db506ca5dab20d605eba793077","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/10573bde039046db506ca5dab20d605eba793077"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/af4ea13a2c02f4fb217eb72469267e244916f917","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/af4ea13a2c02f4fb217eb72469267e244916f917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/af4ea13a2c02f4fb217eb72469267e244916f917","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/af4ea13a2c02f4fb217eb72469267e244916f917/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"3ca7d9d4d6bef1267b6d6af85ea74c20a87ee93d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/3ca7d9d4d6bef1267b6d6af85ea74c20a87ee93d","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/3ca7d9d4d6bef1267b6d6af85ea74c20a87ee93d"}]},{"sha":"3ca7d9d4d6bef1267b6d6af85ea74c20a87ee93d","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OjNjYTdkOWQ0ZDZiZWYxMjY3YjZkNmFmODVlYTc0YzIwYTg3ZWU5M2Q=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-11-05T17:41:50Z"},"committer":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-11-05T17:41:50Z"},"message":"OPENJPA-428.
