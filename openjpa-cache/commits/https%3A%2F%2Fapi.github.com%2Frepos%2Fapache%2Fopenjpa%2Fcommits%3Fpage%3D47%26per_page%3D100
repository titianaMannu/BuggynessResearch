This is mainly because they removed the old file from http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl that we were relying on, but has the side-benefit of removing one network-sensitive component from the release build probless. Unfortunately, this also means that we need to downgrade from version 1.69.1 to 1.67.2 of the docbook stylesheets (since the Maven repository doesn't yet have the newer versions), but that doesn't appear to have any visible effects.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@501704 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"52d687180a7b9cd0fd6870326ca68fcbc9d224a0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/52d687180a7b9cd0fd6870326ca68fcbc9d224a0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6"}]},{"sha":"4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OjRjYjU1YzYyMTA5YmE5ZjA2MjE2M2U1ZjE1ZThmNGE1NmUwNTlhZDY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","email":"mprudhom@apache.org","date":"2007-01-31T03:00:20Z"},"committer":{"name":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","email":"mprudhom@apache.org","date":"2007-01-31T03:00:20Z"},"message":"Use \"settings.localRepository\" instead if \"{user.home}/.m2\" to handle non-standard repository locations.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@501700 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"61a7af012df215286ee68471aaa3795272551cd5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/61a7af012df215286ee68471aaa3795272551cd5"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9"}]},{"sha":"593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OjU5Mzk3N2IwNWE0ZmY2N2Y1ZWJkMjdkMmFiM2M4NDk5OWQyY2NjYTk=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","email":"mprudhom@apache.org","date":"2007-01-31T02:47:00Z"},"committer":{"name":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","email":"mprudhom@apache.org","date":"2007-01-31T02:47:00Z"},"message":"Un-did last change, since maven.home doesn't actually work.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@501696 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"bdc589308971c609c688cdbfcb3a8ef3c310bd76","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/bdc589308971c609c688cdbfcb3a8ef3c310bd76"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/593977b05a4ff67f5ebd27d2ab3c84999d2ccca9/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"6a688205601ebb9e94e047797af7f664de946df1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/6a688205601ebb9e94e047797af7f664de946df1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/6a688205601ebb9e94e047797af7f664de946df1"}]}]
