docbook build mechanism to no longer manually download the docbook files from sourgeforge.net, and instead have the docbook files be a maven dependency, and access the dependency directly. This is mainly because they removed the old file from http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl that we were relying on, but has the side-benefit of removing one network-sensitive component from the release build probless. Unfortunately, this also means that we need to downgrade from version 1.69.1 to 1.67.2 of the docbook stylesheets (since the Maven repository doesn't yet have the newer versions), but that doesn't appear to have any visible effects.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@501704 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"52d687180a7b9cd0fd6870326ca68fcbc9d224a0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/52d687180a7b9cd0fd6870326ca68fcbc9d224a0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/67a73ee0eaa0a903730d5fb1d5f3ffa5f0ca5f68/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/4cb55c62109ba9f062163e5f15e8f4a56e059ad6"}]},{"sha":"aeafc39d3d198e90624fa2895918911204caefd6","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OmFlYWZjMzlkM2QxOThlOTA2MjRmYTI4OTU5MTg5MTEyMDRjYWVmZDY=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Kevin W.

Moved to API-based featureSelection. Query.setHint() can still be used via the query hint => fetch plan binding.\n\nRemoved the logic to override the forUpdate value, since the calling code already incorporates fetch configuration data into its decision about how to invoke toSelect(). Added a test case to assert this behavior.\n\nAlso cleaned up some minor whitespace issues, and reduced code duplication by moving a couple of concepts up into DBDictionary. Removed some seemingly-unnecessary overrides from H2Dictionary.\n\nAdded a test case for isolation level configuration. For non-DB2 dictionaries, it asserts that an exception is thrown during execution. Someone with DB2 knowledge / access should fill in the test case for the DB2 cases. As we add support for per-query isolation level configuration for other databases, we should change this test case.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@525997 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"0d589cc3bfd1e291b30b207ee01411c84ceb240c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/0d589cc3bfd1e291b30b207ee01411c84ceb240c"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"e541936463b4b6be3ab05ded5b2ed224b4692d6b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/e541936463b4b6be3ab05ded5b2ed224b4692d6b","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/e541936463b4b6be3ab05ded5b2ed224b4692d6b"}]},{"sha":"7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OjdmOTk4ZjEwZjEzZWE4NGE2NmI1ZGE0MDVmMGYxMWE5OTBkY2EwYzg=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-04-05T23:13:33Z"},"committer":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-04-05T23:13:33Z"},"message":"Null check.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@525999 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"1a489c27c62895d9403e20b62ac12cebf0e8e540","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/1a489c27c62895d9403e20b62ac12cebf0e8e540"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/814637ca6cd89f237450d24469732b86b91b73b5"}]},{"sha":"57442b70592e83218b1d9ac78c972364308e20d1","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OjU3NDQyYjcwNTkyZTgzMjE4YjFkOWFjNzhjOTcyMzY0MzA4ZTIwZDE=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-04-05T23:57:44Z"},"committer":{"name":"Patrick Linskey","email":"pcl@apache.org","date":"2007-04-05T23:57:44Z"},"message":"HSQL doesn't support locking; short-circuiting tests that require pessimistic locking\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openjpa/trunk@526005 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"7ad4c41e761771d2e28559da39dcb52ce85751ee","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/trees/7ad4c41e761771d2e28559da39dcb52ce85751ee"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/git/commits/57442b70592e83218b1d9ac78c972364308e20d1","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/57442b70592e83218b1d9ac78c972364308e20d1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/57442b70592e83218b1d9ac78c972364308e20d1","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/57442b70592e83218b1d9ac78c972364308e20d1/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/commits/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/commit/7f998f10f13ea84a66b5da405f0f11a990dca0c8"}]},{"sha":"c5d82a70d54136f47033d934e822f397f28f20d2","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjA2MzY0OmM1ZDgyYTcwZDU0MTM2ZjQ3MDMzZDkzNGU4MjJmMzk3ZjI4ZjIwZDI=","commit":{"author":{"name":"Srinivasa Segu","email":"ssegu@apache.org","date":"2007-04-06T05:21:35Z"},"committer":{"name":"Srinivasa Segu","email":"ssegu@apache.org","date":"2007-04-06T05:21:35Z"},"message":"OPENJPA-203.
