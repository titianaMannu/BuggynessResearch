The test case does the following:\n\n1. EntityTransaction.begin()\n2. getReference() on nonexistent record\n3. rollback() in a business method\n4. EntityManager.close(), which fails while running the detach algorithm\n\nIOW, short-circuiting close() won't fix the problem, as close() has only been called once. Additionally, on further inspection, EM.close() asserts that it's open before calling broker.close(), so there will never be multiple close() invocations.\n\nThe problem does not occur in a JTA context, as the persistence context is coincident with the JTA transaction in that scenario, not the lifecycle of the EntityManager.\n\nIt does not seem possible to disable the detach algorithm altogether. However, further investigation indicates that this is probably happening because OpenJPA is not clearing the persistence context during JPA rollback. From section 3.3.2 of the JPA spec:\n\n\"For both transaction-scoped and extended persistence contexts, transaction rollback causes all pre-existing\nmanaged instances and removed instances[15] to become detached. The instances' state will be the\nstate of the instances at the point at which the transaction was rolled back. Transaction rollback typically\ncauses the persistence context to be in an inconsistent state at the point of rollback. In particular,\nthe state of version attributes and generated state (e.g., generated primary keys) may be inconsistent.\nInstances that were formerly managed by the persistence context (including new instances that were\nmade persistent in that transaction) may therefore not be reusable in the same manner as other detached\nobjects—for example, they may fail when passed to the merge operation.[16]\"\n\nResolving this discrepancy will address the case that I'm looking at in particular, but will not address the case where the getReference() method is invoked outside a transaction but in an extended persistence context.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-01-17T19:37:36.855+0000","updated":"2007-01-17T19:37:36.855+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12360647/comment/12465546","id":"12465546","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"New approach: I am going to change OpenJPA's detach algorithms to handle failures more gracefully, and back out the patch I mentioned earlier.
