In this class, the workaround \"new ArrayList()\" is used.\nThe List.subList(int,int) contract is to provide a view on the original list, not a shallow copy (see \"Range-View Operation\" section in http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/interfaces/list.html ). Thus, operations on the subList are in fact done on the original List.\n\nLet's try with the following code:\n\n    myAbstractNonSequentialResultList.subList(first, last).add(myElement);\n\nIf the AbstractNonSequentialResultList class implements the List.subList contract correctly, this should raise an exception because the underlying AbstractResultList is read only (this is the expected result). But with the patch, the above code works correctly and the programmer may think that the underlying List has been modified, while it has still the same number of elements.\n\nSo IMHO, the patch is correct, except for class AbstractNonSequentialResultList which should use a true view of the original List and not a shallow copy. For this class, I see 3 solutions:\n1) the subList method return a true *view* of the original List and not a shallow copy: this would be the best solution (See java.util.AbstractList for an implementation)\n2) the subList method throws a \"not implemented exception\": this would be a quickfix (I'm not sure it would solve the issue)\n3) the subList method return a shallow copy of the original List (i.e. new ArrayList()): this solution is not desirable because it does not respect the List.subList contract as described above.\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkronegg","name":"jkronegg","key":"jkronegg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Julien Kronegg","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Zurich"},"created":"2009-04-21T06:02:37.806+0000","updated":"2009-04-21T06:02:37.806+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12422203/comment/12701154","id":"12701154","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bjreed","name":"bjreed","key":"bjreed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Barrett Jay Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for the quick review Julien.\n\nAttaching OPENJPA-1025b.patch.  For the AbstractNonSequentialResultList case, I think we're going to have to just throw a \"not implemented exception\".  The concrete classes for this use Object[] underneath in stead of a List.  I don't know of a way to create a List \"view\" on to an Object[] and I agree that an exception would be better than returning a modifiable List.  Also, logically, I really wasn't sure that getting a sub list on an object that is \"non sequential\" was really a good idea - doesn't seem like the data would be consistently returned.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bjreed","name":"bjreed","key":"bjreed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Barrett Jay Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-04-21T13:41:32.836+0000","updated":"2009-04-21T13:41:32.836+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12422203/comment/12701178","id":"12701178","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bjreed","name":"bjreed","key":"bjreed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Barrett Jay Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"OPENJPA-1025-withTest.patch includes the code changes from 1025b.patch and an update to the ResultListTest to verify if subList is a supported method or not for each kind of AbstractResultList.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bjreed","name":"bjreed","key":"bjreed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Barrett Jay Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-04-21T15:28:11.005+0000","updated":"2009-04-21T15:28:11.005+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12422203/comment/12701495","id":"12701495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkronegg","name":"jkronegg","key":"jkronegg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Julien Kronegg","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Zurich"},"body":"I applied https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12406031/OPENJPA-1025b.patch : the UnsupportedOperationException is not raised anymore when using subList in my application (Seam CRUD application's EntityList.xhtml).\nThanks B.J., you can apply the patch as a solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkronegg","name":"jkronegg","key":"jkronegg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Julien Kronegg","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Zurich"},"created":"2009-04-22T11:52:21.142+0000","updated":"2009-04-22T11:52:21.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12422203/comment/12704651","id":"12704651","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikedd","name":"mikedd","key":"mikedd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Dick","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm not sure removing the method from AbstractList is the best solution for released versions since we could break downstream consumers.
