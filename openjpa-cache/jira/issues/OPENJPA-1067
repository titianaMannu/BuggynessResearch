We could let the call go through and let the upstream callers handle the exception - rather than checking for supportsQueryTimeout before calling the method. \n\nThat's not a change I'm comfortable making in 1.2.x or 1.0.x though. Negating the call and logging could be done though. \n\nThere's a fair amount of precedent for checking before calling though (avoiding the trip to the database). Unless there are objections I'll open a sub-task / related issue to discuss whether we need the supportsQueryTimeout field.
