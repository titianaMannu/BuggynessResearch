@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP) java.sql.Timestamp\n\nFor trunk (when using the 2.0 default compatibility settings and the new JPA 2.0 Spec required in-place detach and no return values, which differs from the OpenJPA 1.x value-added detach()/detachAll() methods):\n1) find() - entity uses the proxied classes before and after serialization\n2) after in-place detach() - entity does NOT use proxied classes before or after serialization\n3) after in-place detachAll() - none of the entities use proxied classes before or after serialization\n4) detachCopy() - returns an entity that does NOT use proxied classes before or after serialization\n5) clear() - existing entity instances after EM.clear() do NOT use proxied classes before or after serialization\n\nFor 1.3.x (same for proposed
