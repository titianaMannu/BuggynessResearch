Under load, we're not able to push the cpu to 100%. The culprit seems to be the lock and synchronization processing within AbstractBrokerFactory.newBroker(..).

Within a Container-managed environment, the Container takes care of the lifecycle of the EntityManagers. So, there does not seem to be a need to do the findBroker(..) invocation, nor is there a need to keep track of the created EntityManagers (_brokers) so that they can be closed when the Factory is closed. \n\nOnce we have verified these changes, there may be others that are needed.

(It is also guarding the _transactional collection, but findExisting is always false in the OpenJPA codebase, so that code is never used in OpenJPA.) In IMO, the guarding is overly-granular at best, and unneeded at worst.\n\nThe _brokers collection provides us with a means to ensure that when we close a BrokerFactory, all open Brokers are closed along with it. Additionally, we use a weak reference map here, so we don't need to maintain the _brokers collection during Broker.close().\n\nSo, we have a number of options:\n\n1. move the locking logic to be just around the code that maintains the _brokers collection\n\n2. implement a concurrent Collection class that uses weak references, and eliminate all locking\n\n3. create a configuration option (openjpa.CloseBrokersOnBrokerFactoryClose or something) that controls whether or not OpenJPA tracks open brokers.

As Patrick pointed out, the findBroker() is never called since findExisting is always false for OpenJPA, thus the other synch block shouldn't come into play.  Hopefully, with the weak references in ConcurrentReferenceHashSet _brokers, this should help with the blocking and broker cleanup.  Our original experimentation showed that even with the weak references in ReferenceHashSet, we still bogged down during the cleanup of the _brokers collection.

But, as it was iterating through this list, one of the EM instances became null and caused an NPE.  Not sure if this is due to the weak references being GC'd or it indicates a possible problem with the underlying Collections MapBackedSet or something else, but a simple null check gets around this problem.\n\nWith these changes, the initial bottleneck with running OpenJPA in a server environment has been resolved.
