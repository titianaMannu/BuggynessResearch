seen here: http://ant.apache.org/faq.html#delegating-classloader-1.6\n\nThe real fix for this is better documentation, which I will throw together.  I updated the 'no-product-derivations' in the 'openjpa-kernel/src/main/resources/org/apache/openjpa/conf/localizer.properties' file to provide a hint to people who would've run into the same issue I did.\n\n\nThe rest of the patch is to deal with another issue in the same realm as this one, ant that is the fact that the PCEnhancerTask would throw a NPE if you didn't have 'META-INF/persistence.xml' on your system classpath, in $ANT_HOME/lib or supply the dir it was in via the 'ant -lib' argument.  To resolve this, I created a new required attribute for the PCEnhancerTask, named 'configFile'... that allows the location of the config file to be declared when running the task.\n\nPlease provide feedback on the patch if you think I didn't grasp the context of what was going on at a higher level and potentially screwed something else up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bnoll","name":"bnoll","key":"bnoll","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-08-17T22:14:29.000+0000","updated":"2006-08-17T22:14:29.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12348082/comment/12428810","id":"12428810","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bnoll","name":"bnoll","key":"bnoll","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Noll","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching patch named: OPENJPA-14.patch2\n\nIgnore 'OPENJPA-14.patch1 ', I forgot to make the test class I added as part of it.
