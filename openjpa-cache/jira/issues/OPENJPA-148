EJB3 container(EasyBeans in my testcase) is sent to OpenJPA.\nThen, in the method toOpenJPAProperties of org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceUnitInfoImpl class\n\nThe getPersistenceUnitRootUrl() URL (which is the directory URL\n file:/home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/) is transformed\n into /home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/ as it is a \"file:\" URL\n\n\nThen, the getJarFileUrls() is returning the same URL (file:/home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/)\nThis URL is an exploded JAR file URL which is valid for this method as said in the specification\n \"Returns a list of URLs for the jar files or exploded jar file directories that the persistence provider [...]\"\n (It has been clarified between the proposed final specification and the final specification)\n\nThe PersistenceUnitInfoImpl class is then transforming these two URLs into:\n  - \"Files\" property with the value /home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/\n  - \"URLs\" property with the value file:/home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/\n\nThen, these values will be analyzed in  parsePersistentTypeNames(ClassLoader loader) method of\n the class org.apache.openjpa.meta.AbstractCFMetaDataFactory\n\n1/ First, the \"Files\" property is analyzed:\nAs /home/florent/workspace/easybeans/ejb3s/entitybean.jar/ is a directory, it goes in:\n\n                if (file.isDirectory()) {\n                    if (log.isTraceEnabled())\n                        log.trace(_loc.get(\"scanning-directory\", file));\n                    scan(new FileMetaDataIterator(dir, newMetaDataFilter()),\n                        cparser, names, true, file);\n                } \n\nwhich found...nothing. (I have done another test with a file for the PersistenceUnitRootUrl\n (and not a directory) and in this case the scan of the file finds the Entity class while it doesn't\n find the entity class in directory mode).\nAlso here, dir is null, if dir = file, it finds the entity class.\n\nThe corresponding debug trace is:\n[TRACE] MetaData -

I changed it to scan the directory under consideration, which does find the persistent classes in the dir.  I don't know if dir should be set to one of the scanned directories.\n\n2. In the geronimo environment, the same locations show up in both the files and urls lists.  I haven't figured out exactly why.

I think there's something wrong that the same things are showing up in the list of files and the list of urls.  However based on my very limited tracing through the code I think this is caused by some multiple format conversions openjpa is doing: list of urls >> ';' separated string >> list of files + list of urls.  I haven't figured out exactly what is going on here, and any comments on the codes' purpose would be welcome :-)\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-04T17:09:45.790+0000","updated":"2007-05-04T17:09:45.790+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12362833/comment/12496408","id":"12496408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Some more experience indicates my previous patch suffers from at least 2 problems:\n\n- NPE if files is null\n- If one of the URLs is a directory, but not a file, we still get the same problem of trying to read a directory like an xml document.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-16T21:17:04.920+0000","updated":"2007-05-16T21:17:04.920+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12362833/comment/12496410","id":"12496410","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attached patch fixes the 2 additional issues I've found.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-05-16T21:17:50.655+0000","updated":"2007-05-16T21:17:50.655+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12362833/comment/12497575","id":"12497575","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mprudhom","name":"mprudhom","key":"mprudhom","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285"},"displayName":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I've gone ahead and applied OPENJPA-148-2.patch.
