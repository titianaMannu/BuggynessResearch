We have reasonable data structures to capture meta information on a query and that seems to be the right place for lock information rather than a fetch plan hint.\n   b) the default read/write lock levels should be dictated by the currently active lock manager. LockManager.beginTransaction() seems to be one correct place to populate the fetch configuration with these levels. Outside transaction, fetch plan initialization should take current Lock Manager into consideration to set its read/write lock levels.\n   c) OpenJPAConfiguration should impose consistency between LockManager and setOptimistic() \n  \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ppoddar%40apache.org","name":"ppoddar@apache.org","key":"ppoddar@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pinaki Poddar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-03-31T16:31:35.412+0000","updated":"2010-03-31T16:31:35.412+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12460738/comment/12855073","id":"12855073","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curtisr7","name":"curtisr7","key":"curtisr7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Richard G.

I'm posting a patch that will only address the backward compatibility issue. \n\nThe root issue at hand is that in JPA 1.0 a named query had a default lock mode of READ (by OpenJPA's definition, not the spec), but per the 2.0 spec the default lock mode is NONE.\n\nIdeally when we are parsing annotations in AnnotationPersistenceMetaDataParser we could differentiate between a named query which has specified the lockMode vs a default lockMode. Since that doesn't seem to be possible, I'm proposing that if we detect that we're using a pessimistic lock manager and the lockMode is none, we will promote that lock to a READ lock.\n\nThis approach will restore backward compatibility, but will exclude one use case. When using a pessimistic lock manager on 2.0 you will be unable to configure a NamedQuery with the lockMode of NONE.
