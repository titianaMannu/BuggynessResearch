setting/overriding the 'DBDictionary.sequenceSQL' value via a property in the persistence.xml file, as follows:\n\n\t<property name=\"openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary\" value=\"db2(sequenceSQL='SELECT SCHEMA

Rather, the 'default for zOS' is used, i.e.: \"SELECT SCHEMA AS SEQUENCE_SCHEMA, NAME AS SEQUENCE_NAME FROM SYSIBM.SYSSEQUENCES\";.  \n\nTo understand how this is happening, let me describe how 'sequenceSQL' is defined/set at runtime.  First, the ctor of DB2Dictionary is called, and the variable is set to a default:\n\n        sequenceSQL = \"SELECT SEQSCHEMA AS SEQUENCE_SCHEMA, \"\n            + \"SEQNAME AS SEQUENCE_NAME FROM SYSCAT.SEQUENCES\";\n\nAfter the DB2Dictionary ctor is called, openJPA assigns to 'sequenceSQL' the value defined in the system property.  So at this point things are all good and the variable is set to what is defined in the prop.  Where things go awry is when the method DB2Dictionary.connectedConfiguration is called.  In the method there is some platform specific code which is executed which overwrites the sequenceSQL value:\n\n       // platform specific settings\n        switch (db2ServerType) {\n        case  db2ZOSV8xOrLater:\n\t\t........\n            sequenceSQL = \"SELECT SCHEMA AS SEQUENCE_SCHEMA, \"\n                + \"NAME AS SEQUENCE_NAME FROM SYSIBM.SYSSEQUENCES\";\n\nThanks,\n\nHeath","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12451600","id":"12451600","filename":"OPENJPA-1668-1.2.x.patch.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpaheath","name":"jpaheath","key":"jpaheath","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Heath Thomann","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2010-08-09T16:50:41.647+0000","size":5066,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12451600/OPENJPA-1668-1.2.x.patch.txt"}],"customfield_12312340":null,"customfield_12314123":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12314122":null,"customfield_12314121":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12314120":null,"customfield_12314129":null,"customfield_12314524":null,"customfield_12314128":null,"summary":"User's ''DBDictionary.sequenceSQL' setting not being honored on zOS ","customfield_12314130":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"customfield_12314138":null,"customfield_12314137":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12314136":null,"customfield_12314135":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12314134":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12314132":null,"customfield_12314131":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12464706/comment/12868793","id":"12868793","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikedd","name":"mikedd","key":"mikedd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Dick","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This is a case where I wish we had a separate DBDictionary class for Z/OS (although we can't detect it until we have a connection so that would pose its own challenges). \n\nThat said we shouldn't override user settings - the connectedConfiguration method needs to take user settings into account before overwriting the variables. AFAIK there isn't a good way to detect whether a config property was set by the user or just accepted the default value though - so solving the problem might be more kludgy than we'd like. \n\nI'd vote for checking whether sequenceSQL has the default value in connectedConfiguration. If it has the default we'll go ahead and override with a z/os default. If it isn't the default we'll leave it alone (maybe issue a trace statement). \n\nAny other ideas I've missed?
