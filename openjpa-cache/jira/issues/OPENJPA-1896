a POJO is created using a java constructor, merge() cannot store the newly constructed object's data if this means updating a pre-existing record with a matching identity.\n\nThis is a major bug since it means applications where the objects have a natural key cannot use OpenJPA. In my case the example was a filesystem; each crawl of the filesystem generates its own data objects with file path as the natural key. These objects then need to be stored into the database. Previous crawls may have encountered the same files, and the merge operation should cause the latest data from the POJO to be stored in the pre-existing record.\n\nInstead, any attempt to execute either merge() or persist() on an independently constructed object with a matching record identity in the database triggers the same error in the database layer, since OpenJPA attempts to execute an insert for a pre-existing primary key, throwing...\norg.apache.openjpa.lib.jdbc.ReportingSQLException: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"file_pkey\" {prepstmnt 32879825 INSERT INTO file (locationString, location, version, folder) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [params=?, ?, ?, ?]} [code=0, state=23505]\n\nFrom discussion with Rick Curtis on the users@openjpa.apache.org list, this is because the version field on a POJO which is unmanaged is not yet set. \n\nAn ASSUMPTION seems to be made that no such record exists in the database already since it wasn't loaded from the database in the first place, so a persist is attempted. Instead, I recommend the database is QUERIED TO FIND OUT if such a record already exists, and the version field is set correspondingly before attempting the merge() \n\nHere is the corresponding thread containing Ricks comments and links to an example in Github which can recreate the problem.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/hfPjTI\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12466659","id":"12466659","filename":"openjpa-1896.jar","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curtisr7","name":"curtisr7","key":"curtisr7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Richard G.

Curtis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This required two changes to get everything working :\n\n1.] I updated the enhancer (PCEnhancer) so that when we are writing pcIsDetached() if we can't make a definitive answer, to return null. When merging an Entity and we don't know if it is detached, we will query for the Entity to see if we need to issue an UPDATE or an INSERT.\n\n2.] *Note - This is the part that I'm not very excited about.... \n\nThis change is required for an Entity which has a primitive @Version field. After applying fix [1] we now query the DB to see if these Entities exist. Now that we know that we're going to need to do an update, we look at the version field to see if the value is different than those in the DB. In the case of a non-primitive version field, it will be null and we know that it wasn't set. \n\nIn the case of a primitive field, it will be initialized to the types default value. If the current version is greater than the default for the type we will incorrectly throw on optimistic lock exception. To fix the problem I was able to peer inside the Entity and check the value of the pcVersionInit field(added by the Enhancer to detect whether the version field was set, or if it is a default value). Unfortunately the value of this field isn't exposed on the PersistenceCapeable interface, so I had to use reflection.\n\nAfter thinking some more about this, I have an edge case that I can't fix...\n\nLets say I have an Entity with an int version column and for whatever reason the value is 0. Now we find an Entity and stream it out to client 1. Next another client modifies that row so the version gets incremented to 1. Client 1 updates that data and sends it back to the server. At this time we have no state manager and we try to merge it back into the persistence context. This is the problem. We *should* get an OLE here because the current Entity has a version of 0 but the DB has a version of 1. We don't get an OLE because we will assume that the value of the version column is a defaulted value, not one that was actually set there. Make sense?\n\nThe net of this is that we should tell users to either make sure their version columns start with a value greater than 0, or to use non primitive types.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curtisr7","name":"curtisr7","key":"curtisr7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Richard G.
