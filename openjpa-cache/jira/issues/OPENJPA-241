The following is the test I used to reproduce the problem:\n\n@Entity\npublic class Customer {\n...\n    @OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy=\"customer\")\n    private Collection<Order> orders = new ArrayList<Order>();\n...\n}\n\n@Entity\npublic class Order {\n\t@Id \n\t@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n\t int oid;\n\t\n\t double amount;\n\t boolean delivered;\n\t \n\t @ManyToOne (fetch=FetchType.EAGER)\n\t Customer customer;\n...\n}\n\nThe test case:\n\n        String query = \"select c FROM Customer c\";\n        Query q = em.createQuery(query);\n        List list = q.getResultList();\n        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {\n            Customer c = (Customer)list.get(i);\n            System.out.println(\"Customer = \" + c);\n            Collection orders = c.getOrders();\n            for (Iterator iter=orders.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {\n                Order order = (Order)iter.next();\n                System.out.println(\"order = \" + order);\n            }\n        }\n\nAs Rob indicates, since the Orders field in the Customer entity is lazy, when the Customer is first loaded, the Orders will not be loaded. After the Orders is loaded, the extra join sql is executed to get the customer field in the Order because it is an eager field.\n\nThe above test generates the following sql:\n\n(1) SELECT t0.countryCode, t0.id, t0.version, t0.city, t0.state, t0.street, t0.zip \n     FROM PdqCustomer t0 \n\n(2) SELECT t0.name FROM PdqCustomer t0 WHERE t0.countryCode = ? AND t0.id = ? \n\n(3) SELECT t0.oid, t0.version, t0.amount, t0.delivered \n      FROM PdqOrder t0 WHERE t0.CUSTOMER_COUNTRYCODE = ? AND t0.CUSTOMER_ID = ? \n\n(4) SELECT t1.countryCode, t1.id, t1.version, t1.city, t1.state, t1.street, t1.zip \n       FROM PdqOrder t0 \n       INNER JOIN PdqCustomer t1 \n       ON t0.CUSTOMER_COUNTRYCODE = t1.countryCode AND t0.CUSTOMER_ID = t1.id \n        WHERE t0.oid = ?  optimize for 1 row\n\n(5) SELECT t1.countryCode, t1.id, t1.version, t1.city, t1.state, t1.street, t1.zip \n      FROM PdqOrder t0 \n      INNER JOIN PdqCustomer t1 \n     ON t0.CUSTOMER_COUNTRYCODE = t1.countryCode AND t0.CUSTOMER_ID = t1.id \n      WHERE t0.oid = ?  optimize for 1 row\n\n(6) SELECT t1.countryCode, t1.id, t1.version, t1.city, t1.state, t1.street, t1.zip \n      FROM PdqOrder t0 \n      INNER JOIN PdqCustomer t1 \n      ON t0.CUSTOMER_COUNTRYCODE = t1.countryCode AND t0.CUSTOMER_ID = t1.id \n      WHERE t0.oid = ?  optimize for 1 row\n\n(7) SELECT t1.countryCode, t1.id, t1.version, t1.city, t1.state, t1.street, t1.zip \n      FROM PdqOrder t0 \n      INNER JOIN PdqCustomer t1 \n      ON t0.CUSTOMER_COUNTRYCODE = t1.countryCode AND t0.CUSTOMER_ID = t1.id \n      WHERE t0.oid = ?  optimize for 1 row\n \nThe purpose of sql (4) - (7) is to retrieve the inverse relationship of Customer in the Order entity. The attached fix will detect this relationship to get rid of these sql.  \n\nPlease note that this patch included the fix in JIRA-134 scenario 3. Please code review it. Any comments are mostly appreciated.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=faywang","name":"faywang","key":"faywang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fay Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-07-21T23:49:50.079+0000","updated":"2008-07-21T23:49:50.079+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369742/comment/12615699","id":"12615699","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fancy","name":"fancy","key":"fancy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Catalina Wei","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Patch from Fay Wang has been committed in svn r678828","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fancy","name":"fancy","key":"fancy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Catalina Wei","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-07-22T18:01:31.003+0000","updated":"2008-07-22T18:01:31.003+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12369742/comment/12616297","id":"12616297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=faywang","name":"faywang","key":"faywang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Fay Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The attached patch addresses the following issues raised by Pinaki:\n\n1.
