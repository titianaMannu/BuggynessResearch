Let me answer your questions:\n\nQ1) Are you also going to provide patches for 2.3.x and trunk as well?\n\nA1) I applied to 2.2.x and trunk.  I don't use 2.3.x and was thinking others did so I let the interested parties put stuff into 2.3.x as they see fit.  I don't know, maybe no one is using 2.3.x these days??  \n\nQ2) Finally, why is not the \"affected versions\" above set to 2.2.2, 2.3.0 and 2.4.1? I would also set \"fix for versions\" to 2.2.3, 2.3.1 and 2.4.2.\n\nA2) Your question is an interesting one......one could spend all day updating \"affected versions\".  Personally, I use the versions I test on, which is always the latest version of a particular branch.  For example, the testing I was doing was on 2.2.x, and therefore I was using the latest code, which is 2.2.3.  If I was on 1.2.x I'd be using 1.2.4, and as such list it.  Continuing with 1.2.4, I'd take the testing and fix forward to 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, and trunk; where applicable.  As such, I'd list those as the affected versions.\n\nQ3) Shall we resolve this issue, then? \n\nA3) Yes, was getting around to it.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nThanks,\n\nHeath","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jpaheath","name":"jpaheath","key":"jpaheath","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Heath Thomann","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2016-08-15T18:17:40.489+0000","updated":"2016-08-15T18:17:40.489+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12995760/comment/15422306","id":"15422306","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ilgrosso","name":"ilgrosso","key":"ilgrosso","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ilgrosso&avatarId=13240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ilgrosso&avatarId=13240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ilgrosso&avatarId=13240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ilgrosso&avatarId=13240"},"displayName":"Francesco Chicchiriccò","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Rome"},"body":"{quote}\nI don't know, maybe no one is using 2.3.x these days?\n{quote}\n\nThe Syncope maintenance branch 1_2_X [1] is doing that, here's why I've gladly applied your patch :-)\n\n{quote}\nFor example, the testing I was doing was on 2.2.x, and therefore I was using the latest code, which is 2.2.3.
