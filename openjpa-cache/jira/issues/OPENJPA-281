an on-going discussion on the dev mailing list concerning this problem (http://www.nabble.com/Eager-fetching-not-working-with-enums-and-lobs-tf4037105.html).  Since I've gotten agreement on at least one aspect of the problem, I decided to open this JIRA Issue to document the problem.\n\nHere's a summary of the problem:\n\nI am finding that the supposed default action of Eager fetching is not happening with @Enumerated and @Lob fields.  If I explicitly specify the @Basic annotation, then the fields are eagerly fetched.  But, without this extraneous @Basic, these fields are lazily loaded.  This action does not seem to be consistent with the spec.  Nor, can I find any mention of this alternate behavior in our OpenJPA manual.  Sounds like a bug to me.  Any other insights?\n\nThis works (eager loading kicks in):\n\n    @Basic @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    private Gender gender;\n\nThis does not work (lazy loading kicks in):\n\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    private Gender gender;\n\nI have also tried to use defaults (without any annotations), and lazy loading still kicks in:\n\n    private Gender gender;\n\nThe JPA spec attempts to address this situation in section 9.1.18...  Section 9.1.8 of the JPA spec indicates that @Basic is optional and applies to the following types: \n\n\"..Java primitive types, wrappers of the primitive types, java.lang.String, java.math.BigInteger,\njava.math.BigDecimal, java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, java.sql.Date,\njava.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp, byte[], Byte[], char[], Character[],\nenums, and any other type that implements Serializable.\"\n\nAnd, since the default fetch type for @Basic is EAGER, it looks like we need to do eager fetching for both @Enumerated and @Lob fields unless otherwise overridden by a LAZY fetch type (ie. @Basic(fetch=LAZY)).  Agree?\n\nWe're still working on the agreement...  :-)\n\nThanks,\nKevin","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12363049","id":"12363049","filename":"openjpa-281.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

Here's his response:\n\n\"You are correct. Lobs are to be treated like other Basic attributes and should default to EAGER. Your colleague is somewhat justified in that lobs can be costly to load, however, once we put lobs under the category of basic mappings we needed to be consistent and have them use the same defaults. If they are expected to be both large and not referenced often then @Basic(fetch=LAZY) should be used. Note that if one of these is not true then you probably do want them to be eagerly loaded.\n\n-Mike\"\n\nThat should decide it.
