in the middle of processing an afterCompletion invocation in BrokerImpl, an unexpected RuntimeException (IndexOutOfBoundsException) occurred within some underlying WebSphere code.  While we (OpenJPA) were attempting to clean up after that exception, we attempted to call setRollbackOnly on the current transaction.  But, since we were in the process of completing the current transaction, it is invalid to be calling setRollbackOnly and we ended up getting an IllegalStateException from the WebSphere Transaction Manager.  Due this second exception, we ended up losing track of the original exception and this became a difficult problem to diagnose.\n\nThis issue will be used to correct a couple of issues (at least):\n\n1)  We should ensure that the transaction is active before calling\nsetRollbackOnly().  When an exception happens during afterCompletion \nprocessing, the Transaction can no longer accept setRollbackOnly \ninvocations.\n\n2)  When an unexpected exception happens like this, we should log the\nexception before attempting to process the exception.  In this particular\ncase, we lost the original exception when we ran into the IllegalStateException\nfrom the Transaction service.  This forced us to re-run the scenario just to\nget a trace of the exception.\n\n3)  Or, if we don't want to log the exception immediately, we need to determine why we lost the first exception in the first place and ensure that doesn't happen again.\n\nKevin","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[],"customfield_12312340":null,"customfield_12314123":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12314122":null,"customfield_12314121":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12314120":null,"customfield_12314129":null,"customfield_12314524":null,"customfield_12314128":null,"summary":"Do not call setRollbackOnly on inactive Transactions","customfield_12314130":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"customfield_12314138":null,"customfield_12314137":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12314136":null,"customfield_12314135":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12314134":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12314132":null,"customfield_12314131":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12377093/comment/12523962","id":"12523962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

Since we are in the afterCompletion (Synchronization) processing, the Transaction is in a \"completed\" state and can no longer accept the setRollbackOnly invocation.  Although related, Transaction and Synchronization are two separate concepts and should treated as such.\n\nI plan to resolve issue (1) by checking for a valid transaction status before calling setRollbackOnly.  If the transaction is not in a suitable state, I will log a trace message indicating that the setRollbackOnly can not be called, but processing will continue.\n\nRe-looking at the code, I think we are already sufficiently addressing items (2) and (3), once issue (1) is resolved.  We already have the necessary trace logging for this unexpected exception.  Granted, we didn't expect this exception and it's a \"pain\" to turn on trace for long-running scenarios, the real exception that caused the problem in the first place will now get logged due to the fix for (1).  And, since OpenJPA doesn't have the concept of a first-failure-data-capture logging facility, it would get cumbersome to log every unexpected exception.\n\nSo, my plans at this point are to just resolve the first issue (1) with ensuring that we do not attempt to call setRollbackOnly when the transaction can not accept it.

If there is something important to do, then it's important that it complete.\n\n> Is this not true?\n\nYes, that is true.  I was typing before thinking.  :-)  Our afterCompletion processing does do some \"real work\" with ending the transaction, detaching entities, etc.  So, when an exception happens in this code path, it could mean that some of our cleanup didn't complete.  We do log any exceptions that happen during this path via trace statements and the exception does get re-thrown.  It may get wrapped in a suitable PersistenceException, but it will get sent back.\n\nBut, to get back to what I was attempting to explain...  The transaction itself is already completed.  There is nothing we can do at this point to revert the state of that transaction.  It was already either committed or rolled back by the time the afterCompletion method is invoked.  The beforeCompletion and afterCompletion methods on the Synchronization interface are just convenient listener methods.  Any exceptions that may happen due to these calls will not affect the outcome of the Transaction (since it is already complete).  And, from my experience, the Synchronization implementation will not stop processing just because an exception happens.  They will log the condition (as we have seen) and then continue processing.\n\nHope this helps.\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

We are performing this \"afterCompletion\" processing as far as we can until we hit this unexpected exception.  This exception is now being logged (if trace is turned on) and the exception is returned to the caller.  Unless you are suggesting that we should possibly log-and-eat this exception and attempt to continue additional processing as if nothing has happened, I think we have done everything we can do.  If we went this log-and-eat route, it would require more more granular try-catch blocks in this path.  Not sure this is necessary processing for the unexpected (rare) case.\n\nFYI, we are still flowing through the EntityManager with the setRollbackOnly invocation.  So, any processing in the EntityManager and/or Broker that would be triggered because of the setRollbackOnly call will still happen.  It's just the explicit setRollbackOnly call on the Transaction object itself that was conditionally skipped if the Transaction was not \"active\".  Just wanted to clarify that aspect of the change.\n\nIf there are still concerns about the general exception processing in the OpenJPA code base, then maybe we should open a separate JIRA issue or at least start a [DISCUSSION] topic on our dev mailing list.  The original intent of this Issue was to not call the setRollbackOnly method when the Transaction is not in a state to accept the invocation.  I think that issue has been resolved.  But, maybe there are still concerns about the general exception processing within OpenJPA...\n\nThanks,\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.
