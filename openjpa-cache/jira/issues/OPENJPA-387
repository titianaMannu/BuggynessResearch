But, I have a couple of questions about the patch itself...\n\nWith this patch, could we be accidentally be corrupting the loaderCaches?  We first lookup the proper loaderCache based on the loader being\nused on the first attempt.  Since the problem is surfacing with a non-null loader variable, then we have looked up an existing loaderCache (or just created one).  But, then if we drop into your new code (because the class wasn't cached yet), then we null out the loader variable and try again.  If this one succeeds, then we store the class into the loaderCache instance that was first accessed by the non-null loader instance.  Is that what we really want to do?  It seems that we may need the loaderCache lookup as part of the while loop as well.  Either that, or we need more explanation on the keys being used for the loaderCache lookups.\n\nSecond comment...  Why limit the retry to packages that don't start with \"org.apache.openjpa\"?  Why not just re-try all class lookup failures with a null class loader and see if they work?  It's always possible that somebody may have named their plugin with \"org.apache.openjpa.*\", especially if they are just testing.\n\nThanks,\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.
