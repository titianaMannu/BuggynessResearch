problem was first discussed on our dev mailing list:  http://www.nabble.com/Cloning-Calendar-proxies-tf4571181.html\n\nPer the discussion on that thread, I am proposing to modify the generated proxy code to override the clone() method.  This clone() method will do the necessary copying of data from the original object, but then also null out the sm (StateManager) and zero out the field attributes.  This action detaches the cloned object from the StateManager (and associated EntityManager).\n\nInstead of limiting this action to the Calendar proxy, I am adding the clone() method implementation to all of our proxy objects that we generate.  Granted, some of the object types do not directly support the clone() method, but that will be detected when or if anybody attempts to use the clone() method on these types (compiler generated error message).\n\nI'll be posting a patch shortly and I plan to commit the changes later today (unless there is opposition).\n\nThanks,\nKevin","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12367265","id":"12367265","filename":"OPENJPA-396.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

In the generated clone method, after calling super.clone(), why do you not simply invoke stateManager = null; pcState = 0; instead of calling the setOwner(null, 0) method? Seems like there is additional code in setOwner that you want to avoid because there is not yet any relationship between the owner and the sco. The effect of calling this method from the clone might be to disassociate the original sco.\n\nCraig,\nThe original reason is that I couldn't figure out the proper serp invocations to just set those two fields.  :-)  Then, I found the setOwner method on the Proxy (also generated code) that did just what I was looking for.  So, it was more straight-forward to just call this method than to repeat the same code.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the setOwner has no other side effects.  I am calling setOwner on the Proxy, not the StateManager.  The code is generated in the ProxyManagerImpl class (addProxyMethods method).  And, the javadoc for this method is as follows:\n\n    /**\n     * Reset the state of the proxy, and set the owning instance of the\n     * proxy and the name of the field it is assigned to. Set to null to\n     * indicate that the proxy is no longer managed.\n     */\n    public void setOwner(OpenJPAStateManager sm, int field);\n\nKevin\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

The original problem surfaced because of a .equals() invocation between two Calendar objects.  So, even though the Javadoc explains what attributes of a given Calendar, Date, Time, etc object are examined for .equals(), I just wanted to ensure that we didn't hit this problem again in the future because some JVM decided to change their implementation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.
