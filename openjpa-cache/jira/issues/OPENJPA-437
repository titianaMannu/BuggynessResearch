As I continued to look at this problem, both _pcClassNames and _pcClassLoaders are not synchronized.  Patrick's fix for OPENJPA-449 to move the creation of the _pcClassLoaders structure to the constructor closed the window for the scenario described in OPENJPA-449, but it's still not protected from multiple client/thread access.  (Note, my previous comments in the Description about _pcClassLoaders being protected were not accurate.)\n\nI could change both of these Collections to be synchronized, but the code was getting a bit ugly due to the still required synchronization for the iterators.  Since these two Collections are only modified in this method, an easy solution would be to make the method Synchronized.  Since this method is only used when creating new brokers, this shouldn't affect the through put.\n\nAlso, the logic for this method is based on the return value of the loadPersistentTypes on the MetaDataRepository instance.  This method is also synchronized, so we'd be following suit.\n\nAny concerns about going the route of synchronizing the AbstractBrokerFactory.loadPersistentTypes method?\n\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

While this addresses the thread safety issue, it also introduces a bottleneck for applications with a large number of concurrent threads creating new EntityManagers. This was not a bottleneck in the previous (unsafe) code since the synchronized repository call was only made once.\n\nAttached is a patch that I believe is both thread-safe and unsynchronized. There might be a better datastructure other than a ConcurrentReferenceHashSet, but I think that it should do the job.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-25T16:43:10.278+0000","updated":"2008-01-25T16:43:10.278+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12382100/comment/12562568","id":"12562568","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Reopening pending discussion of synchronization.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-01-25T16:43:30.382+0000","updated":"2008-01-25T16:43:30.382+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12382100/comment/12562686","id":"12562686","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

But, it was my understanding that the ConcurrentReferenceHashSet still has an unprotected Iterator.  So, later on in this same loadPersistentTypes() method, the _pcClassNames structure is iterated through.  To make this iterator safe, then I would have to synchronize around this as well.  Also, the _pcClassLoaders should also be made thread-safe since we're updating that structure in this same method.  When I put in all of the necessary safeguards, it looked like it might be cleaner just by making the method synchronized.\n\nBut, if we're hitting a bottleneck by making that method synchronized, then we probably need to change it.  I had not discovered that bottleneck yet...\n\nSo, do we need to add the following items to your patch?\n\no  Initialize _pcClassLoaders with a ConcurrentReferenceHashSet.\no  Protect the _pcClassNames iterator usage with a synch block\n\nThanks,\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.
