Sutter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"It's turning out that we have two problems to resolve via this defect.  The first (more immediate) problem is to remove the usage of the internal WebSphere API usage.  Currently, OpenJPA is using one of three API's to get access to the WebSphere TransactionManager.  These API's were never meant to be used by applications or other persistence mechanisms.  The API's in question are:\n\n        \"com.ibm.ejs.jts.jta.JTSXA.getTransactionManager\"\n        \"com.ibm.ejs.jts.jta.TransactionManagerFactory.getTransactionManager\"\n        \"com.ibm.ws.Transaction.TransactionManagerFactory.getTransactionManager\"\n\nInstead, the preferred (public, documented) method of interfacing with the WebSphere TransactionManager is via the\nExtendedJTATransaction interface.  This provides similar access to TM-like functions without opening direct access to the TM, which could possibly cause integrity issues.  This will involve looking up the java:/comp/websphere/ExtendedJTATransaction object, and then using this object to register for synchronization (which also uses a websphere-specific interface, to protect the innocent).\n\nThat's the first step.  We need to do this first so that we can get WebSphere's buy-in of the OpenJPA project.\n\nThe follow-on issue is to introduce the usage of the Java EE 5 feature for the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry.  This will standardize the persistence provider's access to TM's across all Java EE 5 application servers.  We will leave the other mechanisms in place for non-Java EE 5 compliant application servers, but the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry will be the first option to try.  Once we get the first item complete (using the WebSphere interfaces), this item should follow shortly.\n\nPlease comment with any questions or concerns with this approach.  Thanks.\n\nKevin","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kwsutter","name":"kwsutter","key":"kwsutter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin W.

So, if the use of the proper ExtendedJTATransaction interface was limited to JPA, then we could remove the other three internal API references.

This will allow us to use the standard TransactionSynchronizationRegistry interface without breaking the ManagedRuntime contracts. The only shortcoming is that direct control over the Transaction will fail (since TransactionSynchronizationRegistry doesn't provide direct access to the current Transaction).\n\nNote also that this patch will require us to update our JTA dependency from geronimo-jta_1.0.1B_spec to geronimo-jta_1.1_spec. I don't envision that being a problem, since it should be backwards-compatible.\n\nI will need someone who has access to a container that supports the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry interface to test this out before we can commit it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mprudhom","name":"mprudhom","key":"mprudhom","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mprudhom&avatarId=45285"},"displayName":"Marc Prud'hommeaux","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2007-04-22T21:24:25.138+0000","updated":"2007-04-22T21:24:25.138+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12351985/comment/12491409","id":"12491409","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mikedd","name":"mikedd","key":"mikedd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Dick","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Marc, I started testing this with the WebSphere EJB3 feature pack.
