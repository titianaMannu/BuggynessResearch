testing is showing a severe data cache performance degradation when moving from 1.0.x OpenJPA code to 1.2.0 level code.  Profiling showed the problem to be in the new random eviction scheme which runs when the cache reaches its maximum number of entries.  This code was changed significantly when OpenJPA moved to Java 5 java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap and away from the OpenJPA implementation of ConcurrentHashMap.  A macro-benchmark showed a 20% performance degradation from base 1.2.0 code when the cache reaches its maximum size; prompting eviction in order to add new cache entries.\n\nI've found that the new random eviction code appears to be improved in the very recent 666903 commit, but data cache performance remains considerably slower than the 1.0.x implementation.  Profiles with the 666903 changes show test threads to be waiting on the reentrant write lock in the CacheMap wrapper (which now wrappers a max size capable, null handling, subclass of java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap).  Investigation is underway to determine whether the write lock is necessary (ie. can java.util.conncurrentConcurrentHashMap manage the cache without the need for external locking) and/or if changes could be made which would result in a significant reduction in contention for the lock.  Any thoughts/ideas on that would be extremely helpful.\n\nPerformance tests run with the 1.2.0 code base, using the OpenJPA version of ConcurrentHashMap (instead of the Java 5 java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap-based implementation) have shown that  performance of the data cache is significantly better when the legacy OpenJPA implementation is used.  Based on the results, it appears that OpenJPA should be using the the legacy ConcurrentHashMap instead of the Java 5-based implementation -- or the new Java 5-based implementation needs to be improved considerably in order to perform as well as 1.0.x.\n\nI am opening this as a 1.2.0 issue, although it very likely affects 1.1.x as well.  Testing has not been performed on 1.1.x to confirm the problem exists on that release.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12384524","id":"12384524","filename":"CacheImplTest.jar","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=techhusky","name":"techhusky","key":"techhusky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Bauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2008-06-23T19:36:34.464+0000","size":81390,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12384524/CacheImplTest.jar"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12384142","id":"12384142","filename":"OPENJPA-637.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=techhusky","name":"techhusky","key":"techhusky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Bauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2008-06-17T16:50:24.565+0000","size":34219,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12384142/OPENJPA-637.patch"}],"customfield_12312340":null,"customfield_12314123":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12314122":null,"customfield_12314121":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12314120":null,"customfield_12314129":null,"customfield_12314524":null,"customfield_12314128":null,"summary":"Significant performance degradation when data cache is enabled","customfield_12314130":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"customfield_12314138":null,"customfield_12314137":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12314136":null,"customfield_12314135":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12314134":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12314132":null,"customfield_12314131":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398364/comment/12605654","id":"12605654","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=techhusky","name":"techhusky","key":"techhusky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Bauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Attaching a patch for 1.2.0 which adds-back and utilizes the OpenJPA ConcurrentHashMap implementation.

Performance started to degrade at a certain point by further increasing the max cache size . The benchmark showed better results with a max size of 5000 than it did for 10000+. (Default (1000) and 15000 were also tested, 5000 appeared to be optimal for this workload.) The database tables used in the benchmark fluctuate around 35000 rows, which roughly equate to entities.\n\nOut of curiousity, instead of using CacheMap as the cache store in ConcurrentDataCache, java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap was used directly in its place (soft ref, write locking, and pinning support were removed for simplification). This also eliminated the max size and null handling aspects of the cache. Benchmark performance with this configuration was very similar to measurements taken with the data cache disabled. Database (on a separate server) utilization was down considerably, which was good & expected, but the benchmark was not showing a performance improvement. In contrast, 1.2.0 using the 1.0.x code showed a ~20% improvement when the data cache (max cache size 5000) was enabled.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=techhusky","name":"techhusky","key":"techhusky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Bauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2008-06-18T20:27:31.874+0000","updated":"2008-06-18T20:27:31.874+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12398364/comment/12606140","id":"12606140","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pcl","name":"pcl","key":"pcl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Patrick Linskey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Interesting.

It behaves similarly to the benchmark that exposed this problem.  The test allows  configuration of number of threads, max data size, max cache size, whether external locking is enabled, and the cache implementation type.\n\nThis test is showing similar results as to what I've previously posted; a write lock causing contention when the cache becomes full.  When the external write lock (a reentrant lock over and above internal cache locking) is enabled and the data size is ~5000 entries larger than the max cache size performance drops significantly.  The external lock simulates the reentrant lock used by DataCacheStoreManager to ensure the cache does not get updated with an old version of data.\n\nThis test should provide a better idea of what I'm seeing.  Aside, there is an option to run directly with java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap and it performs very well - although there is no null masking or maximum size on the cache.  \n\nTo get a list of options:  java -cp CacheImplTest.jar;commons-collections-3.2.jar cachetest.Main\n\nPatrick - What behavior/environment does your benchmark test?
