svn client. One particular issue is OS-specific line-endings for text files. When you add a new text file, especially when applying patches from Bugzilla, first ensure that the line-endings are appropriate for your system, then do ...\n\nsvn add test.txt\nsvn propset svn:eol-style native test.txt\n\nYour svn client can be configured to do that automatically for some common file types. Add the contents of the file http://www.apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt to your ~/.subversion/config file. [Note: for Windows this is normally found at C:\\Documents and Settings\\{username}\\Application Data\\Subversion\\config]\n\nSome files may need additional properties to be set, for example svn:executable=* should be applied to those script files (e.g. .bat, .cgi, .cmd, .sh) that are intended to be executed. Since not all such files are necessarily intended to be executed, the executable property should not be made an automatic default.\n\nHowever, you should still pay attention to the messages from your svn client when you do 'svn commit'.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12314523":null,"customfield_12314127":null,"customfield_12314522":null,"customfield_12314126":null,"customfield_12314521":null,"customfield_12314125":null,"customfield_12314520":null,"customfield_12314124":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12399471","id":"12399471","filename":"OPENJPA-896-trunk.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drwoods","name":"drwoods","key":"drwoods","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433"},"displayName":"Donald Woods","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2009-02-04T19:00:04.045+0000","size":416089,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12399471/OPENJPA-896-trunk.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12399489","id":"12399489","filename":"OPENJPA-896-trunk-withprops.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drwoods","name":"drwoods","key":"drwoods","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433"},"displayName":"Donald Woods","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2009-02-04T22:40:28.041+0000","size":420845,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12399489/OPENJPA-896-trunk-withprops.patch"}],"customfield_12312340":null,"customfield_12314123":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12314122":null,"customfield_12314121":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12314120":null,"customfield_12314129":null,"customfield_12314524":null,"customfield_12314128":null,"summary":"Several source files include Windows EoL chars","customfield_12314130":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"customfield_12314138":null,"customfield_12314137":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12314136":null,"customfield_12314135":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"customfield_12314134":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12314132":null,"customfield_12314131":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414006/comment/12670409","id":"12670409","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drwoods","name":"drwoods","key":"drwoods","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=drwoods&avatarId=20433"},"displayName":"Donald Woods","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Patch file which removes the Windows Ctrl+M EOL chars.\nFor Windows users, you can use a program like SlickEdit to resave the files in Unix format (and fix your svn config.)\nFor Unix/Linux users, use the \"dos2unix *.xml\" command.\nFor Mac users, you need to provide a dos2unix script that uses the tr command -\n{noformat}\n#!
