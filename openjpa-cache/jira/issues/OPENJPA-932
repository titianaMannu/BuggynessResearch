(OpenJPA trace groups are well documented in the manual, so if a new group would need to be doc'd if consensus is that a new group should be added.).  While this exception shows up during enhancement, it is in product derivation code so openjpa.Runtime may be better?\n\n- I'm still struggling a bit with constructing a new config to get a logger, but OpenJPA doesn't really have anything configured at this point and I can't think of a cleaner way to get this important warning out there without other potentially messy changes.  The null check is good, IMHO.  The comment regarding its necessity can be removed.\n\n- The error message isn't completely clear as to what the problem is or how to fix it.  I think wording which includes the notion that \"persistence unit names should be unique\" may help.  (I'd say must, but as this problem points out, we don't enforce it)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=techhusky","name":"techhusky","key":"techhusky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeremy Bauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2009-03-06T17:26:02.419+0000","updated":"2009-03-06T17:26:02.419+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12415255/comment/12680489","id":"12680489","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curtisr7","name":"curtisr7","key":"curtisr7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Richard G.
